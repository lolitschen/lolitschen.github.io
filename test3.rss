    <strong>Grocery shopping can be a real hassle - especially if
    you live far from grocery stores.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Depending on where you live, you can get groceries delivered
  right to your door with <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOpn5O">AmazonFresh</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Here's how to sign up for the service and how to use it.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  You can cross the grocery store
  off your list of things to do this week, even if you're not
  crossing off grocery shopping.
</p>
      <p>
  What, you say, is this black
  magic? No magic, but rather the joy of <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOpn5O">AmazonFresh</a>. The online retailer has brought together
  ecommerce and fresh produce, and it may just be the best feature
  that Amazon has to offer. Here's how to sign up for the grocery
  delivery service.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>1. Check to see if <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOpn5O">AmazonFresh</a> is available where
  you live</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  To determine whether or not your
  zip code qualifies, visit Amazon.com/AmazonFresh. If the service
  is available, you're in luck! Continue onward.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>2. Sign up for your free 30-day trial</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  In order to entice new
  subscribers to try out the service, Amazon is offering up a
  30-day free trial for new members. Simply select "Start your
  30-day free trial," and follow the on-screen instructions. If you
  enjoy the experience and want to continue past your 30-day trial,
  <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOpn5O">AmazonFresh</a> will set you back $14.99 per
  month.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>3. Start shopping locally</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  Once you've signed up, you can
  order fresh produce and groceries for delivery either later on
  the same day or the very next day. You'll be able to browse
  selections from local shops and supermarkets, buying everything
  from fresh fish to berries to rolls of paper towels. Amazon has
  divided its online grocery store into a few easy categories,
  including Dairy, Deli, Bakery, Fresh Fruit, Meal Kits, and
  Beverages.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>4. Decide how you want
  your delivery</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  There are a few options for
  delivery:
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>
    Attended delivery is available
    in all cities where AmazonFresh is available. Simply select a
    one-hour time slot when you'll be around to receive your
    groceries. You'll receive items in paper bags rather than the
    traditional temperature-controlled tote.
  </li>
  <li>
    You could also elect to have
    your order left with a doorman or security guard. Simply leave
    instructions when necessary for delivery on the preview order
    page under delivery instructions. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Doorstep Delivery is also
    available in all cities where AmazonFresh is available. Rather
    than a one-hour time slot, you'll be selecting a two to
    three-hour time slot that fits with your schedule. When you get
    home, you'll find your groceries on your doorstep in a
    temperature-controlled tote. Note that Doorstep Delivery
    <em>must</em>
    involve a doorstep - if your
    building has a secure entry or limited access, this may not be
    the best option. 
    
  </li>
  <li>
    If you need to change delivery
    times or dates, be sure that you do so before the order has
    started processing. This can be done through <em>Order
    Details</em>. 
    
  </li>
</ul>
      <h2>
  <strong>5. Pay for your delivery</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  Depending on what city you live
  in, there may be a different free shipping threshold. Assuming
  you've surpassed this threshold (it's generally low enough to be
  easily surpassed if you're shopping for a week's worth of
  groceries), then both Attended and Doorstep Delivery are free. If
  you don't pass the local free shipping threshold before tax,
  you'll have to pay a $9.99 delivery fee.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>6. Alternatively, use <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOpn5O">AmazonFresh</a> Pickup</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  This option is available only in
  select cities, is completely free, and does not require an order
  minimum. Simply select your groceries and then choose a pickup
  location as your <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOpn5O">AmazonFresh</a> account address, then
  reserve a time slot. Your groceries could be ready for pickup in
  as little as 30 minutes.
</p>
      <p>
  While you may have a bit of
  trepidation around buying groceries sight unseen, know that
  Amazon's customer service team makes shopping on AmazonFresh
  quite seamless. You have a 30-day refund policy at your disposal
  if you aren't satisfied with the condition of your Fresh
  items.

    <strong>After years of living in tiny apartments and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/saving-money">saving
    money</a> for down payment on a house, Anna Baluch bought her
    home and hired someone to clean for the first time.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>She did the math and realized that three hours of her
    time working from home was worth more than the $80 per month
    she pays her cleaner.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Paying for the service started to change the way she
    thinks about outsourcing tasks - even when living frugally, it
    can be worth spending money to save time.</strong>

</ul>
      <p>
  As someone who's instantly stressed by a cluttered space, a clean
  house is very important to me. Unfortunately, however, cleaning
  takes time. 
</p>
      <p>
  Scrubbing bathrooms, mopping hardwood floors, vacuuming carpet,
  wiping down baseboards, and dusting surfaces is a time-consuming
  endeavor, even if you don't have any kids or pets like me. Even
  though my house is only about 1,900 square feet, it takes at
  least three hours to give it a good deep clean.
</p>
      <p>
  I had never used a cleaning before because I had only lived in
  tiny apartments and had been focused on saving for a down
  payment. When <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paid-off-mortgage-early-freedom-2019-3">
  we bought our house in central Ohio</a>, I was working a
  full-time job and writing on the side, so I was a lot busier that
  I'd been before we moved. A few weeks after we moved in, I
  decided to try a cleaning service. 
</p>

                </figure>
      <p>
  I asked for recommendations for trustworthy and professional
  cleaning professionals in my community's local Facebook page.
  After interviewing a couple of the recommended cleaners, I found
  a woman who said she could clean my entire house from top to
  bottom for $80. I decided to hire her one time to see whether it
  was worth it.
</p>
      <p>
  She came over one morning while my husband and I were at work and
  cleaned the top and lower levels of our raised ranch. That
  afternoon, I came home from work to a sparkling clean house that
  smelled great and instantly put me in a good mood. I was
  mesmerized by the polished furniture, glowing floors, and
  gleaming kitchen counters. It didn't take me long to call her up
  and let her know that I'd like to hire her to clean my house once
  a month.
</p>
      <p>
  Since I am now self-employed, my time is more valuable to me than
  it ever was before. Lost time means lost dollars, so to me and my
  husband, a cleaning service is well worth the money. I figured
  out how much I earn on average per hour from writing and realized
  that it makes financial sense for me to pay $80 a month to have
  my entire house deep cleaned than lose a few hours of writing
  time.
</p>
      <figure class="op-interactive">
                
                <iframe><script async type='text/javascript' id="myFinance-widget-script">!function(){function e(){var e=document.createElement("script"),n=document.getElementById("myFinance-widget-script"),a=t+"static/widget/myFinance.js";e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src=a,n.parentNode.insertBefore(e,n);var c="myFinance-widget-css";if(!document.getElementById(c)){var d=document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0],i=document.createElement("link");i.id=c,i.rel="stylesheet",i.type="text/css",i.href=t+"static/widget/myFinance.css",i.media="all",d.appendChild(i)}}var t="https://www.myfinance.com/";document.attachEvent?document.attachEvent("onreadystatechange",function(){"complete"===document.readyState&&e()}):document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",e,!1)}();</script><div class="myFinance-widget" data-widget-id="d8c4d306-acaa-4f40-8143-1949a50c55fd" data-campaign="bi-cap-one-aff"></div></iframe>
                
                </figure>
      <p>
  Also, it's more important to me to spend the weekends relaxing
  and enjoying time with friends and family than saving $80 once a
  month. Although I am generally a frugal person, a cleaning
  service is something I refuse to save money on. It makes my
  husband and me happy and less-stressed, making it well worth the
  investment.
</p>
      <p>
  While we still do laundry, put away dishes, organize our mail,
  and perform other common household chores that keep the house
  tidy, we don't have to worry about finding the time to clean
  every single component of every single room in our house. We can
  count on Lisa, our cleaning provider, to come over on the last
  Tuesday of every month and work her magic.
</p>
      <figure class="op-interactive">
                
                <iframe><script async type='text/javascript' id="myFinance-widget-script">!function(){function e(){var e=document.createElement("script"),n=document.getElementById("myFinance-widget-script"),a=t+"static/widget/myFinance.js";e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src=a,n.parentNode.insertBefore(e,n);var c="myFinance-widget-css";if(!document.getElementById(c)){var d=document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0],i=document.createElement("link");i.id=c,i.rel="stylesheet",i.type="text/css",i.href=t+"static/widget/myFinance.css",i.media="all",d.appendChild(i)}}var t="https://www.myfinance.com/";document.attachEvent?document.attachEvent("onreadystatechange",function(){"complete"===document.readyState&&e()}):document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",e,!1)}();</script><div class="myFinance-widget" data-widget-id="d8c4d306-acaa-4f40-8143-1949a50c55fd" data-campaign="bi-cap-one-aff"></div></iframe>
                
                </figure>
      <p>
  Hiring Lisa has showed me that it's worth it to spend money on
  services that bring convenience and sanity to my life. Now, I'm
  not afraid to order takeout or groceries online on days that I'm
  extra busy and simply don't have the time to shop or cook. It's
  become easier for me to outsource tasks that take up a great deal
  of my time or make my life more stressful than it needs to be,
  and for that - along with a sparkling house - I'm grateful I
  hired a house cleaner.

  <li>Jump Capital, the venture investing arm of Jump Trading, has
  invested $5 million in the Small Exchange.
  </li>
  <li>Jump Trading, one of the largest futures trading firms, plans
  to bring liquidity to the exchange, which is catering to Main
  Street investors with smaller, less-complex futures contracts. 
  </li>
  <li>Exchanges have recently shown an interest in attracting
  individual investors to futures. 
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  The Small Exchange just got a big boost. 
</p>
      <p>
  Jump Capital, the venture investing arm of Chicago-based
  market-maker Jump Trading, has made a $5 million investment in
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/small-exchange-hopes-to-bring-more-retail-customers-to-futures-market-2019-1">
  the trading venue aimed at making futures more accessible to Main
  Street</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  The Small Exchange plans to offer small-sized futures contracts
  that are easier to trade for retail customers. Most futures
  contracts are too expensive for Main Street investors to trade
  them. 
</p>
      <p>
  "We think that there is an untapped opportunity to make futures
  products more accessible to individual investors," Peter Johnson,
  a principal at Jump Capital, told Business Insider. "We think
  that the combination of the founding team in the Small Exchange
  ... with our capital markets experience sets them up really well
  to be successful in that venture."

  A former TD Ameritrade exec wants to make futures trading more
  accessible to Main Street, and a dozen brokers have signed
  up</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Arguably more important than the investment is Jump's involvement
  in the exchange as a strategic partner. Jump Trading is one of
  the largest market-makers in the futures market.
</p>
      <p>
  Johnson said Jump plans to be a "foundational participant" for
  the exchange, serving as a market-maker there. In January,
  Roberts told Business Insider 12 brokers had already given verbal
  commitments to the exchange. 
</p>
      <p>
  "For any new exchange, liquidity is of utmost importance, and
  having one of the largest futures traders in the world helping to
  provide that should certainly be helpful in making the exchange
  attractive," Johnson said.

  CME's CEO explains how Main Street is taking more control over
  its portfolio from Wall Street and how the futures exchange is
  adapting</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Donnie Roberts, Small Exchange's CEO and the former president and
  chief operating officer at TD Ameritrade's futures and forex
  division, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/small-exchange-hopes-to-bring-more-retail-customers-to-futures-market-2019-1">
  told Business Insider in January</a> the trading venue would
  initially offer five cash-settled contracts based on proprietary
  indices.
</p>
      <p>
  The Small Exchange isn't alone in its push to open up the futures
  market. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cmes-terry-duffy-talks-about-retail-investors-increased-activity-2019-3">
  CME unveiled plans to launch micro versions of its most popular
  futures</a> to cater towards individual investors. In 2018, CME
  saw a 27% bump in retail customers' trading activity from the
  previous year. 
</p>
      <p>
  CME's new contracts, which are subject to regulatory approval,
  are scheduled to go live in May. In January, Roberts said he was
  aiming to launch the exchange in the beginning of the third
  quarter, but worried the government shutdown, which was taking
  place at the time, might impact those plans.
</p>
      <p>
  Johnson dismissed the idea that CME's new contract could eat into
  the market share the Small Exchange was going after. 
</p>
      <p>
  "We see it as a rise in tide," he said. "It's a recognition of
  this trend by another big player in the market. ... It brings
  visibility to these types of products, which is good."
