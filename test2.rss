                    &lt;p&gt;“There were arms everywhere,” Drew Harvell recalls. “It looked like a blast zone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was 2013, eight days before Christmas. Harvell and her colleagues were walking along Seattle’s Alki Beach, sweeping their headlamps over wet gravel, exposed by a receding tide. Wherever they looked, they saw dead and dying sea stars. Some had disintegrated into white mush. Others were still alive, their bodies riddled with sores and their arms twisting at grotesque angles. Yet others seemed to be pulling themselves apart. “There were arms separating from sea stars, arms walking off by themselves,” says &lt;a href="https://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/catherine-drew-harvell?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Harvell&lt;/a&gt;, an ecologist at Cornell University who studies marine diseases. “That was my first experience of the magnitude of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar omens had been accumulating all fall. Harvell had received emails about a mysterious disease outbreak afflicting sea stars in British Columbia. She had read &lt;a href="https://echinoblog.blogspot.com/2013/09/mysterious-mass-starfish-die-off-in.html?utm_source=fbia"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; about “a huge mortality event” that was littering the sea floor with disintegrating arms. She had heard reports that even captive sea stars in Vancouver Aquarium were dying. This unprecedented phenomenon, known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_star_wasting_disease?utm_source=fbia"&gt;sea star wasting disease&lt;/a&gt; (SSWD), ultimately affected more than 20 species. Similar die-offs had occurred before, but never at this scale. All along the western coast of North America, from Alaska to Mexico, the stars were blinking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/04/the-great-sea-urchin-crisis/360491/?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Read: The great sea urchin crisis&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvell and her colleagues considered a laundry list of possible causes, including storms, pollutants, and radiation from the Fukushima disaster. But the syndrome always looked like an infection, and in 2014 the team &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2014/11/17/the-fault-in-our-stars-might-be-a-virus/?utm_source=fbia"&gt;identified a possible culprit&lt;/a&gt;—a virus that they called sea star-associated densovirus, or SSaDV. That virus doesn’t cause SSWD &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2018.00077/full?utm_source=fbia"&gt;in every affected species&lt;/a&gt;, though, so there’s still a lot of uncertainty about the syndrome’s cause (or causes). Its impact, however, is undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaau7042?utm_source=fbia"&gt;In a new analysis&lt;/a&gt;, Harvell collated data from over 10,000 surveys, carried out by trained citizen scientists diving off the Pacific coast. Their observations showed that SSWD has brought one especially susceptible species—the mighty sunflower star—to near-total ruin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_sea_star?utm_source=fbia"&gt;sunflower star&lt;/a&gt; is the starfish equivalent of a &lt;em&gt;Tyrannosaurus&lt;/em&gt;—a huge, voracious, unmistakable alpha-predator. With a three-foot diameter, up to 26 arms, and hundreds of tubular feet, it runs down clams, sea urchins, and snails at a top speed of six inches per second. “This thing was as common as a robin,” Harvell says. “You would go on a dive and always see sunflower stars.” But since 2013, it has largely vanished from most of its former 2,000-mile range; only in Alaska do appreciable populations still remain. In just a few years, an emerging disease has caused the continental-scale collapse of a once-common species, and started to remake the underwater world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people have said that maybe they migrated to deeper water, and they’re down there somewhere,” Harvell says. But data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have snuffed out that hope. They show that between 2013 and 2015, the sunflowers completely disappeared from the deep waters off California and Oregon, and declined by 99.2 percent near Washington. In 2016, NOAA researchers couldn’t find a single individual in almost 700 trawls. This last summer, they saw just one. “That shocked everyone, including me,” Harvell says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="189" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/01/harvell3HR/89775c7d0.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Two photos of the same rock, 20 days apart. Credit: Neil Mcdaniel&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of any species is a tragedy. But the loss of the sunflower is especially devastating because it’s a keystone predator—a creature that has a disproportionately large influence on the world. The legendary ecologist &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/06/rip-bob-paine-a-keystone-among-ecologists/486995/?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Bob Paine&lt;/a&gt; coined the keystone concept in 1963, after yanking starfish from a Washington beach, and hurling them into the sea. A year later, the mussels that the starfish would have eaten had overrun the shoreline, displaced the creatures that formerly lived there, and remodeled the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSWD is effectively carrying out the same experiment, but on an epic scale. In the absence of the sunflowers, the sea urchins they hunt are running amok, eating their way through the Pacific’s kelp forests. Kelp is a tagliatelle-like seaweed whose meter-tall fronds shelter vast communities of marine life. If they fall, an entire ecosystem will fall too, including several commercially important species like abalones, crabs, and countless fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/1980/?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Such changes&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/5487602-181/collapse-of-kelp-forest-imperils?utm_source=fbia"&gt;already begun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.0553?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;utm_source=fbia"&gt;especially in places&lt;/a&gt; where that other major predator of sea urchins—the sea otter—has also declined. Once-lush worlds of green and yellow foliage are now “urchin barrens”—desolate domains of purple spines and chewed stumps. “Kelp forests along the west coast have been hit hard, and are likely to diminish further as these sunflower star predators become extremely rare,” says &lt;a href="http://msi.ucsb.edu/people/research-scientists/carol-blanchette-0?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Carol Blanchette&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California, Santa Barbara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/plastic-junk-coral-disease/551495/?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Read: 11 billion pieces of plastic are riddling corals with disease&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Things are currently not looking great,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/pacificrockyintertidal/data-products/sea-star-wasting/?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Melissa Miner&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California, Santa Cruz. “But from talking to researchers and divers, my understanding is that [the sunflowers] are still present throughout their entire range; you just need to look harder for them now. My hunch is that this is a fast-growing species, which might have the potential to recover quickly if whatever is causing SSWD subsides. I think there is hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But disease is only part of the story. Harvell’s team found that the sunflower’s decline coincided with abnormally strong heatwaves, and the higher temperatures rose above their usual levels, the more likely the stars were to disappear. Harvell suspects that warm waters could have either boosted the growth of whatever microbe is behind SSWD, or stressed the sunflowers, making them more susceptible to infections. “The warming didn’t necessarily trigger the outbreak, but I think it increased the impact of the disease,” Harvell says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be the norm in the future. In Harvell’s upcoming book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520296978/ocean-outbreak?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Ocean Outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, she documents several cases in which infections have wreaked havoc on corals, abalone, salmon, and other marine creatures. In some cases, the changing climate has worsened these contagions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Land-living animals face the same double whammy. While the sea stars were disintegrating, on the other side of the world, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/why-did-two-thirds-of-this-weird-antelope-suddenly-drop-dead/550676/?utm_source=fbia"&gt;two-thirds of the world’s population of saiga&lt;/a&gt;—a bulbous-nosed Asian antelope—dropped dead. They died without warning, in a few days, over an area the size of Florida. And it seems that they were killed by a normally harmless nasal bacterium that, thanks to an unprecedented spell of heat and humidity, infiltrated their bloodstreams and poisoned them. Climate change plus contagion equals mass mortality: It’s a chilling equation for a changing world.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;As the sun rose on Wednesday, 26 million Americans peered out their windows onto a land chilled to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. And that’s when the air was still: When the wind picked up, as it did from Chicago to the Dakotas, it could feel &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/capitalweather/status/1090636572461072388?utm_source=fbia"&gt;like it was 50 below&lt;/a&gt;. Boiling water tossed from a pot turned into a cloud of snow before it could hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience was half &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Uz?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Uz&lt;/a&gt;, half Oz. &lt;span&gt;But had Dorothy’s house been relocated to Mount Everest, not Munchkinland, her journey still would have been more pleasant than many midwesterners’ Wednesdays. They spent the day essentially shut down, as hundreds of schools, offices, universities, and even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.twincities.com/2019/01/29/minneapolis-st-paul-cold-weather-closures-restaurants-museums-ice-castle/?utm_source=fbia"&gt;an ice castle&lt;/a&gt; closed. The National Weather Service &lt;a href="https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/01/29/chicago-weather-forecast-extreme-cold/?utm_source=fbia"&gt;advised&lt;/a&gt; against “talking” or “taking deep breaths” outside so as to keep delicate lung tissue from freezing on contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The vortex was felt nearly across the entire continent. As many as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RyanMaue/status/1090604823962181640?utm_source=fbia"&gt;225 million Americans&lt;/a&gt;—from Alabama to Nevada—could have started their 8 a.m. commute in below-freezing temperatures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; is dangerous, record-breaking, can’t-look-away weather. Yet this cold snap’s arrival was preceded by a marvel so spectacular that we hardly noticed it: It was correctly predicted. As early as a month ago, forecasters knew that colder-than-average weather would likely strike North America this month; a week ago, computer models spit out some of the same figures that appeared on thermometers today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meteorologists have never gotten a shiny magazine cover or a brooding Aaron Sorkin film, and the weather-research hub of Norman, Oklahoma, is rarely mentioned in the same breath as Palo Alto. But over the past few decades, scientists have gotten significantly—even staggeringly—better at predicting the weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much better? “A modern five-day forecast is as accurate as a one-day forecast was in 1980,” says &lt;a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/342?utm_source=fbia"&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt;, published last week in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science. &lt;/em&gt;“Useful forecasts now reach nine to 10 days into the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper is a birthday present from meteorology to itself: The American Meteorological Society turns 100 this year. But it also acts as a good report card on how far weather prediction has come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Modern 72-hour predictions of hurricane tracks are more accurate than 24-hour forecasts were 40 years ago,” the authors write. The federal government now predicts storm surge, stream level, and the likelihood of drought. It has also gotten better at talking about its forecasts: &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/09/how-the-national-weather-service-prepares-fo?utm_source=fbia"&gt;As I wrote in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, the National Weather Service has dropped professional jargon in favor of clear, direct, and everyday language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everybody’s improving, and they’re improving a lot,” says &lt;a href="https://www.geosc.psu.edu/academic-faculty/alley-richard?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Richard Alley&lt;/a&gt;, an author of the paper and a geoscientist at Penn State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the current polar vortex, the first signs came almost a month in advance. &lt;a href="http://www.severe-weather.eu/long-range-2/sudden-stratospheric-warming-underway/?utm_source=fbia"&gt;On the final day of 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, scientists detected what they call a &lt;/span&gt;“sudden stratospheric warming event,”&lt;span&gt; high above the North Pole. The stratosphere, a layer of air about 20 miles above the surface, was being rocked by waves of warm air from below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic,” &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/polar-vortex-is-about-to-split-up-5c2e7460-67fb-49da-b73a-079ffbe205b9.html?utm_source=fbia"&gt;warned the meteorologist Andrew Freedman&lt;/a&gt; at the time&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“Sudden stratospheric warming events are known to affect the weather in the U.S. and Europe on a time delay.” The next 60 days would probably be colder than average, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By January 20, much of North America &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/01/21/dc-area-forecast-frigid-through-tuesday-before-midweek-thaw-with-rain-then-turning-cold-again/?utm_term=.b135d88c10a8&amp;amp;utm_source=fbia"&gt;hit its first cold snap&lt;/a&gt; of the season. Then, a week ago, the European weather model began to project that a dangerous air mass would descend over the central United States. “It’s safe to say that the [European] weather model cannot get any colder for the Midwest,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RyanMaue/status/1088171947169595392?utm_source=fbia"&gt;said the meteorologist Ryan Maue&lt;/a&gt;. “Wind chills would be in the -40 degree to -50 degree Fahrenheit range as well. This would be bad … but hopefully the model moderates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model barely budged. On Wednesday morning, Minneapolis recorded a wind chill of –52 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of pattern—where a seasonal climatic projection (it will be colder than average at the end of the month) precedes a definite week-ahead forecast (it will be -40 degrees in on Tuesday)—will become more common in the years to come. Meteorologists are increasingly uniting weather models and climate models, allowing them to project the general contours of a season as it begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The conventional wisdom was that weather prediction would saturate after a week or so” because the atmosphere is chaotic, &lt;a href="https://www.ucar.edu/who-we-are/leadership/about-antonio-j-busalacchi?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Antonio Busalacchi&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, told me. But “new areas of forecasting… really take an Earth-systems-science approach. It’s no longer just [modeling] the atmosphere by itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding months-long events like El Niño, for instance, has allowed meteorologists to go beyond the seven-day forecast. Alley, the Penn State professor, said he was awed by the new models. Well-studied features of Earth’s climate—like the temperate &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Gulf Stream&lt;/a&gt; in the Atlantic Ocean—emerge in computer models even though developers have only written code that mimics basic physics. “You translate Newtonian physics into a sphere and get &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force?utm_source=fbia"&gt;Coriolis [force]&lt;/a&gt;,” he said. “There’s no line in the code that says, &lt;em&gt;Please make a Gulf Stream. &lt;/em&gt;But it is the physics of the Earth, so when you spin it up, the Gulf Stream appears because it has to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now surrounded by the products of these miraculous models. In 2009, &lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitalweathergang/2009/09/how_much_do_you_value_a_foreca.html?utm_source=fbia"&gt;a back-of-the-envelope study&lt;/a&gt; estimated that U.S. adults check the weather forecast about 300 billion times per year. Perhaps in all that checking we have forgotten how strange the forecast, how almost supernatural it is that people can describe the weather before it happens. More than 1,000 years ago, the Spanish archbishop Agobard of Lyon &lt;a href="https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/Agobard-OnHailandThunder.asp?utm_source=fbia"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that no witch could control the weather because only God could understand it. “Man does not know the paths of the clouds, nor their perfect knowledges,” he wrote. He &lt;a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/kjv/job/37.html?utm_source=fbia"&gt;cited the Book of Job&lt;/a&gt; for authority, which asks: “Dost thou know when God … caused the light of his cloud to shine? Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds…?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no sleight to any whirlwind—Arctic, divine, or otherwise—to point out that Americans now certainly do know the balancings of the clouds. There is a basic-cable channel devoted to the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
