    <strong>Grocery shopping can be a real hassle - especially if
    you live far from grocery stores.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Depending on where you live, you can get groceries delivered
  right to your door with <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOpn5O">AmazonFresh</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Here's how to sign up for the service and how to use it.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  You can cross the grocery store
  off your list of things to do this week, even if you're not
  crossing off grocery shopping.
</p>
      <p>
  What, you say, is this black
  magic? No magic, but rather the joy of <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOpn5O">AmazonFresh</a>. The online retailer has brought together
  ecommerce and fresh produce, and it may just be the best feature
  that Amazon has to offer. Here's how to sign up for the grocery
  delivery service.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>1. Check to see if <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOpn5O">AmazonFresh</a> is available where
  you live</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  To determine whether or not your
  zip code qualifies, visit Amazon.com/AmazonFresh. If the service
  is available, you're in luck! Continue onward.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>2. Sign up for your free 30-day trial</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  In order to entice new
  subscribers to try out the service, Amazon is offering up a
  30-day free trial for new members. Simply select "Start your
  30-day free trial," and follow the on-screen instructions. If you
  enjoy the experience and want to continue past your 30-day trial,
  <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOpn5O">AmazonFresh</a> will set you back $14.99 per
  month.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>3. Start shopping locally</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  Once you've signed up, you can
  order fresh produce and groceries for delivery either later on
  the same day or the very next day. You'll be able to browse
  selections from local shops and supermarkets, buying everything
  from fresh fish to berries to rolls of paper towels. Amazon has
  divided its online grocery store into a few easy categories,
  including Dairy, Deli, Bakery, Fresh Fruit, Meal Kits, and
  Beverages.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>4. Decide how you want
  your delivery</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  There are a few options for
  delivery:
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>
    Attended delivery is available
    in all cities where AmazonFresh is available. Simply select a
    one-hour time slot when you'll be around to receive your
    groceries. You'll receive items in paper bags rather than the
    traditional temperature-controlled tote.
  </li>
  <li>
    You could also elect to have
    your order left with a doorman or security guard. Simply leave
    instructions when necessary for delivery on the preview order
    page under delivery instructions. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Doorstep Delivery is also
    available in all cities where AmazonFresh is available. Rather
    than a one-hour time slot, you'll be selecting a two to
    three-hour time slot that fits with your schedule. When you get
    home, you'll find your groceries on your doorstep in a
    temperature-controlled tote. Note that Doorstep Delivery
    <em>must</em>
    involve a doorstep - if your
    building has a secure entry or limited access, this may not be
    the best option. 
    
  </li>
  <li>
    If you need to change delivery
    times or dates, be sure that you do so before the order has
    started processing. This can be done through <em>Order
    Details</em>. 
    
  </li>
</ul>
      <h2>
  <strong>5. Pay for your delivery</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  Depending on what city you live
  in, there may be a different free shipping threshold. Assuming
  you've surpassed this threshold (it's generally low enough to be
  easily surpassed if you're shopping for a week's worth of
  groceries), then both Attended and Doorstep Delivery are free. If
  you don't pass the local free shipping threshold before tax,
  you'll have to pay a $9.99 delivery fee.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>6. Alternatively, use <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOpn5O">AmazonFresh</a> Pickup</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  This option is available only in
  select cities, is completely free, and does not require an order
  minimum. Simply select your groceries and then choose a pickup
  location as your <a href="https://amzn.to/2IOpn5O">AmazonFresh</a> account address, then
  reserve a time slot. Your groceries could be ready for pickup in
  as little as 30 minutes.
</p>
      <p>
  While you may have a bit of
  trepidation around buying groceries sight unseen, know that
  Amazon's customer service team makes shopping on AmazonFresh
  quite seamless. You have a 30-day refund policy at your disposal
  if you aren't satisfied with the condition of your Fresh
  items.

    <strong>After years of living in tiny apartments and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/saving-money">saving
    money</a> for down payment on a house, Anna Baluch bought her
    home and hired someone to clean for the first time.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>She did the math and realized that three hours of her
    time working from home was worth more than the $80 per month
    she pays her cleaner.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Paying for the service started to change the way she
    thinks about outsourcing tasks - even when living frugally, it
    can be worth spending money to save time.</strong>

</ul>
      <p>
  As someone who's instantly stressed by a cluttered space, a clean
  house is very important to me. Unfortunately, however, cleaning
  takes time. 
</p>
      <p>
  Scrubbing bathrooms, mopping hardwood floors, vacuuming carpet,
  wiping down baseboards, and dusting surfaces is a time-consuming
  endeavor, even if you don't have any kids or pets like me. Even
  though my house is only about 1,900 square feet, it takes at
  least three hours to give it a good deep clean.
</p>
      <p>
  I had never used a cleaning before because I had only lived in
  tiny apartments and had been focused on saving for a down
  payment. When <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paid-off-mortgage-early-freedom-2019-3">
  we bought our house in central Ohio</a>, I was working a
  full-time job and writing on the side, so I was a lot busier that
  I'd been before we moved. A few weeks after we moved in, I
  decided to try a cleaning service. 
</p>

                </figure>
      <p>
  I asked for recommendations for trustworthy and professional
  cleaning professionals in my community's local Facebook page.
  After interviewing a couple of the recommended cleaners, I found
  a woman who said she could clean my entire house from top to
  bottom for $80. I decided to hire her one time to see whether it
  was worth it.
</p>
      <p>
  She came over one morning while my husband and I were at work and
  cleaned the top and lower levels of our raised ranch. That
  afternoon, I came home from work to a sparkling clean house that
  smelled great and instantly put me in a good mood. I was
  mesmerized by the polished furniture, glowing floors, and
  gleaming kitchen counters. It didn't take me long to call her up
  and let her know that I'd like to hire her to clean my house once
  a month.
</p>
      <p>
  Since I am now self-employed, my time is more valuable to me than
  it ever was before. Lost time means lost dollars, so to me and my
  husband, a cleaning service is well worth the money. I figured
  out how much I earn on average per hour from writing and realized
  that it makes financial sense for me to pay $80 a month to have
  my entire house deep cleaned than lose a few hours of writing
  time.
</p>
      <figure class="op-interactive">
                
                <iframe><script async type='text/javascript' id="myFinance-widget-script">!function(){function e(){var e=document.createElement("script"),n=document.getElementById("myFinance-widget-script"),a=t+"static/widget/myFinance.js";e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src=a,n.parentNode.insertBefore(e,n);var c="myFinance-widget-css";if(!document.getElementById(c)){var d=document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0],i=document.createElement("link");i.id=c,i.rel="stylesheet",i.type="text/css",i.href=t+"static/widget/myFinance.css",i.media="all",d.appendChild(i)}}var t="https://www.myfinance.com/";document.attachEvent?document.attachEvent("onreadystatechange",function(){"complete"===document.readyState&&e()}):document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",e,!1)}();</script><div class="myFinance-widget" data-widget-id="d8c4d306-acaa-4f40-8143-1949a50c55fd" data-campaign="bi-cap-one-aff"></div></iframe>
                
                </figure>
      <p>
  Also, it's more important to me to spend the weekends relaxing
  and enjoying time with friends and family than saving $80 once a
  month. Although I am generally a frugal person, a cleaning
  service is something I refuse to save money on. It makes my
  husband and me happy and less-stressed, making it well worth the
  investment.
</p>
      <p>
  While we still do laundry, put away dishes, organize our mail,
  and perform other common household chores that keep the house
  tidy, we don't have to worry about finding the time to clean
  every single component of every single room in our house. We can
  count on Lisa, our cleaning provider, to come over on the last
  Tuesday of every month and work her magic.
</p>
      <figure class="op-interactive">
                
                <iframe><script async type='text/javascript' id="myFinance-widget-script">!function(){function e(){var e=document.createElement("script"),n=document.getElementById("myFinance-widget-script"),a=t+"static/widget/myFinance.js";e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src=a,n.parentNode.insertBefore(e,n);var c="myFinance-widget-css";if(!document.getElementById(c)){var d=document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0],i=document.createElement("link");i.id=c,i.rel="stylesheet",i.type="text/css",i.href=t+"static/widget/myFinance.css",i.media="all",d.appendChild(i)}}var t="https://www.myfinance.com/";document.attachEvent?document.attachEvent("onreadystatechange",function(){"complete"===document.readyState&&e()}):document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",e,!1)}();</script><div class="myFinance-widget" data-widget-id="d8c4d306-acaa-4f40-8143-1949a50c55fd" data-campaign="bi-cap-one-aff"></div></iframe>
                
                </figure>
      <p>
  Hiring Lisa has showed me that it's worth it to spend money on
  services that bring convenience and sanity to my life. Now, I'm
  not afraid to order takeout or groceries online on days that I'm
  extra busy and simply don't have the time to shop or cook. It's
  become easier for me to outsource tasks that take up a great deal
  of my time or make my life more stressful than it needs to be,
  and for that - along with a sparkling house - I'm grateful I
  hired a house cleaner.

  <li>Jump Capital, the venture investing arm of Jump Trading, has
  invested $5 million in the Small Exchange.
  </li>
  <li>Jump Trading, one of the largest futures trading firms, plans
  to bring liquidity to the exchange, which is catering to Main
  Street investors with smaller, less-complex futures contracts. 
  </li>
  <li>Exchanges have recently shown an interest in attracting
  individual investors to futures. 
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  The Small Exchange just got a big boost. 
</p>
      <p>
  Jump Capital, the venture investing arm of Chicago-based
  market-maker Jump Trading, has made a $5 million investment in
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/small-exchange-hopes-to-bring-more-retail-customers-to-futures-market-2019-1">
  the trading venue aimed at making futures more accessible to Main
  Street</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  The Small Exchange plans to offer small-sized futures contracts
  that are easier to trade for retail customers. Most futures
  contracts are too expensive for Main Street investors to trade
  them. 
</p>
      <p>
  "We think that there is an untapped opportunity to make futures
  products more accessible to individual investors," Peter Johnson,
  a principal at Jump Capital, told Business Insider. "We think
  that the combination of the founding team in the Small Exchange
  ... with our capital markets experience sets them up really well
  to be successful in that venture."

  A former TD Ameritrade exec wants to make futures trading more
  accessible to Main Street, and a dozen brokers have signed
  up</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Arguably more important than the investment is Jump's involvement
  in the exchange as a strategic partner. Jump Trading is one of
  the largest market-makers in the futures market.
</p>
      <p>
  Johnson said Jump plans to be a "foundational participant" for
  the exchange, serving as a market-maker there. In January,
  Roberts told Business Insider 12 brokers had already given verbal
  commitments to the exchange. 
</p>
      <p>
  "For any new exchange, liquidity is of utmost importance, and
  having one of the largest futures traders in the world helping to
  provide that should certainly be helpful in making the exchange
  attractive," Johnson said.

  CME's CEO explains how Main Street is taking more control over
  its portfolio from Wall Street and how the futures exchange is
  adapting</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Donnie Roberts, Small Exchange's CEO and the former president and
  chief operating officer at TD Ameritrade's futures and forex
  division, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/small-exchange-hopes-to-bring-more-retail-customers-to-futures-market-2019-1">
  told Business Insider in January</a> the trading venue would
  initially offer five cash-settled contracts based on proprietary
  indices.
</p>
      <p>
  The Small Exchange isn't alone in its push to open up the futures
  market. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cmes-terry-duffy-talks-about-retail-investors-increased-activity-2019-3">
  CME unveiled plans to launch micro versions of its most popular
  futures</a> to cater towards individual investors. In 2018, CME
  saw a 27% bump in retail customers' trading activity from the
  previous year. 
</p>
      <p>
  CME's new contracts, which are subject to regulatory approval,
  are scheduled to go live in May. In January, Roberts said he was
  aiming to launch the exchange in the beginning of the third
  quarter, but worried the government shutdown, which was taking
  place at the time, might impact those plans.
</p>
      <p>
  Johnson dismissed the idea that CME's new contract could eat into
  the market share the Small Exchange was going after. 
</p>
      <p>
  "We see it as a rise in tide," he said. "It's a recognition of
  this trend by another big player in the market. ... It brings
  visibility to these types of products, which is good."

      <ul>
  <li>Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable urges Change UK to ditch
  "petty tribalism" and form an electoral alliance.
  </li>
  <li>Cable has so failed to persuade the new anti-Brexit party of
  former Conservative and Labour MPs to form a pro-Remain alliance
  for the upcoming European elections and beyond.
  </li>
  <li>Supporters fear this refusal to cooperate will split the
  Remain vote and hurt anti-Brexit parties.
  </li>
  <li>Cable told Business Insider that an electoral alliance was
  "common sense" and that millions of Remain voters would feel
  "angry and betrayed" if parties did not work together.
  </li>
  <li>Lib Dem Tom Brake hit back at Change UK suggestions that the
  Lib Dems had a bleak future.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  LONDON - The Liberal Democrats have accused a fellow anti-Brexit
  party of "petty tribalism" after Change UK questioned the future
  of the Lib Dems and told its members and donors to quit and join
  their party instead.
</p>
      <p>
  Change UK, the pro-Remain party set up in February by eleven
  former Conservative and Labour MPs, is being urged by some of its
  backers to form an electoral alliance with the anti-Brexit Lib
  Dems.
</p>
      <p>
  Supporters of this idea argue that it would maximise the Remain
  vote and prevent it being split across a number of parties. Lib
  Dem leader Sir Vince Cable backs it and wanted it to take shape
  before the European elections next month.
</p>
      <p>
  However, Change UK opposes an electoral alliance, and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6954283/Change-UK-group-plots-destroy-Lib-Dems.html">aims to take members, donors, and
  voters from the Lib Dems.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  Its economic spokesperson, Chris Leslie MP, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/change-uk-chris-leslie-anti-brexit-alliance-will-not-ever-be-likely-2019-4?r=US&amp;IR=T">told Business Insider last
  week</a> that the Lib Dems had "fallen below a critical mass" and
  had "baggage," <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8491438/independent-group-mps-rule-out-deal-with-lib-dems-and-say-they-aim-to-run-the-country/">and has previously said</a> that
  they have an "issue of trust" with the public.
</p>
      <p>
  Speaking at the Lib Dems' European elections launch on Friday,
  Cable said it was a "pity" that Change UK did not want to form an
  alliance, and accused the new party of betraying millions of
  Remain voters nationwide.
</p>
      <p>
  He told Business Insider that the Lib Dems would "rise above it"
  and said: "There are millions of people out there willing us to
  work together and they will feel angry and betrayed if they find
  petty tribalism is trumping that.
</p>
      <p>
  "That's the old politics - and I thought they [Change UK] were
  trying to get away from it. We certainly are.
</p>
      <p>
  "At the end of this, common sense will prevail."
</p>
      <p>
  He added: "There are individual comments by individual members
  but that isn't my sense of where they collectively are, to the
  extent which they have a collective voice."

      <h2>
  Lib Dems have more 'strength and depth' than Change UK
</h2>
      <p>
  Cable was supported by the Lib Dem Brexit spokesperson, Tom
  Brake, who told Business Insider that his party was the one "with
  the strength and depth" to be successful in next month's European
  elections.
</p>
      <p>
  "We will have a manifesto. We haven't had any difficulties with
  our candidates," Brake said. Two Change UK members this week
  stood down as European election candidates for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/change-uk-brexit-racism-ali-sadjady-romania-pickpockets-european-elections-a8883241.html">racist</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/24/change-uk-european-election-candidate-joseph-russo-steps-down-offensive-tweets">sexist</a> remarks posted online.

  He added: "They [Change UK] will be able to look at the last real
  electoral test before the European elections, which is the
  council elections where we expect to do very well, in contrast to
  Change UK, which hasn't got any candidates standing because they
  weren't actually formed as a party at the point when the
  nominations were opened."
</p>
      <p>
  Cable used the party's European elections launch to describe the
  Lib Dems as "the party of Remain" and said that a vote for his
  party late next month was a vote to stop the United Kingdom's
  exit from the European Union.

  <li>Catalyte is a Baltimore tech company which identifies
  unlikely potential software developers using AI, regardless of
  their social or educational backgrounds.
  </li>
  <li>Catalyte has trained up fast-food workers, truck drivers and
  construction workers and, on a case-by-case basis, even
  ex-felons. Some go on to work at big tech firms.
  </li>
  <li>The company says its revenues have increased seven-fold over
  a two-year period, from $10m to over $70m.
  </li>
  <li>Speaking to Business Insider, CEO Jacob Hsu says the company
  is "seriously considering" going public, adding that it will be
  "well-positioned" for an IPO in the next twelve months.

</ul>
      <p>
  What do you think when you hear the words 'software developer'?
</p>
      <p>
  The clich<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C3%A9"/>é is
  someone who's a lifelong nerd or brogrammer type, almost
  inevitably male, and who has done a stint at Facebook, Google, or
  another major tech firm. They probably have a computer science or
  engineering qualification under their belt, and maybe went to an
  elite university.
</p>
      <p>
  Jacob Hsu is familiar with the pattern. Hsu is CEO of Catalyte,
  an IT services company, having joined in 2017. Headquartered in
  Baltimore, Catalyte manages software and digital transformation
  projects for clients such as Nike, making it much like any other
  IT services and consulting firm.
</p>
      <p>
  But Catalyte has an unusual approach to hiring teams of software
  engineers, which the company says results in a much more diverse
  workforce. To recruit trainee engineers, it uses an algorithm
  which does not factor in anything to do with applicants' social
  or educational backgrounds.
</p>
      <p>
  When Hsu first joined, he was sceptical that an algorithm could
  really result in diverse hiring.
</p>
      <p>
  "When I was just about to join, I thought the hiring process just
  can't work - I thought it must be impossible," he tells Business
  Insider.
</p>
      <p>
  Software engineering is a notoriously male-dominated field. In
  2017, just 26% of professional computing occupations in the U.S.
  workforce were held by women, <a href="https://www.ncwit.org/resources/numbers">according to the</a>
  <a href="https://www.ncwit.org/resources/numbers">National Center
  for Women &amp; Information Technology</a>.  In 2018, the hiring
  programme HackerRank <a href="https://research.hackerrank.com/women-in-tech/2018">surveyed</a>
  14,000 software developers around the world, of whom only 2,000
  were women.
</p>
      <p>
  But Hsu's experience at Catalyte was different.
</p>
      <p>
  "The moment I walked through the door, it hit me. Nearly a third
  of the programmers [at Catalyte] were African American. A third
  of the programmers were women. It was like nothing I'd ever
  seen."
</p>
      <p>
  Catalyte offers a two-year intensive training course in software
  development. When trainees have finished the course, the idea is
  that they will be competent enough to work as full-time software
  developers - whether for Catalyte and its clients or anywhere
  else.
</p>
      <p>
  The company's recruitment algorithm selects people for the
  training course, but applicants don't know they're being assessed
  by an algorithm. Instead, the application process is disguised as
  a traditional test.
</p>
      <p>
  As offbeat as Catalyte might sound, the company says it has grown
  seven-fold in two years, with its revenue growing from $10m to
  over $70 million.
</p>
      <p>
  Graduates of the programme work for companies including
  Microsoft, Amazon, and Paypal, and go from an average salary of
  $25,000 before to an average of $85,000 within 24 months of
  finishing.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>"One-third of our software developers have no more than a
  high-school education"</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  In Catalyte's Baltimore office (which is also its headquarters),
  28% of the office's software developers are African American. The
  African American population of Baltimore is 29%. The thinking is
  that Catalyte's local software teams should reflect the cities
  they work in.
</p>
      <p>
  "One of our programme graduates is an African-American lady who
  spent 16 years as a public school science teacher," Hsu said. "At
  one of the schools she taught at, she was asked to teach basic
  coding, which she had no prior experience of. She realised she
  had an aptitude for it, and that's what got her interested in our
  programme. But she said she would have dropped out of our
  programme were it not for the focus on teamwork."
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c7589e62628982c72080f98-1920-1280.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <h1>Hsu believes the misconception that software development is solitary can put women off entering the industry.</h1>
          <cite>Maskot/Getty</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  Indeed, Hsu thinks the teamwork required by modern software
  development is also the reason why Catalyte takes on more female
  developers. "People often ask me about diversity in tech. I think
  the reason you see fewer women in software development is because
  it's viewed as a solitary activity.
</p>
      <p>
  "But modern software development is a team sport. The teams pull
  each other through. It's like going through the army. Nine out of
  ten people who undergo our training programme stay on
  permanently. But if they didn't have a peer group around them,
  they wouldn't survive our training. If I enrolled on our training
  programme now, I don't think I'd make it through."
</p>
      <p>
  Hsu claims the training is so thorough that clients assume teams
  of relative novices are old pros.
</p>
      <p>
  "When Michael [Rosenbaum, Catalyte's founder] was first
  establishing Catalyte, a company asked a Catalyte team to build
  some software for them, almost as a Hail Mary, " Hsu explains.
  "The team built it so efficiently that the company assumed they
  were ex-Navy Seals with college degrees. But our staff had worked
  at Taco Bell, or as Park Rangers, or as high-school teachers."
</p>
      <p>
  There are unlikely techies peppered throughout the company, he
  added.
</p>
      <p>
  "Our current director of training operations joined us eight
  years ago as a trainee software developer. Before joining us, he
  spent 20 years as a roofing contractor, but lost everything in
  the recession, including his house. The leadership skills he
  learned as a roofing contractor make his work at Catalyte easier.
</p>
      <p>
  "One-third of the developers we train have no more than a
  high-school education. We re-employ truck drivers, fast-food
  workers, architects - you name it."
</p>
      <p>
  On its site, Catalyte says it won't recruit people with felonies
  but Hsu said the company makes some exceptions.
</p>
      <p>
  "We have even hired people with criminal backgrounds. Usually,
  it's difficult to hire people with felonies, but we have done so
  on a case-by-case basis," he said.
</p>
      <h2>
  How does an algorithm spot an unlikely but promising techie?
</h2>
      <p>
  At a time when tech firms seem to be having trouble hiring
  diversely, how does Catalyte pull it off?
</p>
      <p>
  Hsu explained: "We put out ads stating that we're looking for
  trainee software developers who will ultimately go on to work for
  major companies, but we make it clear that no prior experience of
  software development is necessary."
</p>
      <p>
  <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90269298/this-company-uses-ai-to-test-unlikely-engineers-for-their-potential">
  According to one Fast Company profile</a>, Catalyte posts job ads
  to Craigslist, a classifieds site more commonly used to find
  stuff like furniture on the cheap than to find a high-paying
  software job. Most engineers look in more conventional places for
  new gigs, like Stack Overflow.
</p>
      <p>
  Hsu continued: "In the test, there's a math section, an essay
  section, and a values section. But it's not about assessing your
  answers to those sections. You can score 100% on them and still
  fail to be selected for our programme.
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc0578d74565330556500f3-1920-1440.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <h1>Catalyte's recruitment algorithm takes into account 500 factors when assessing applicants.</h1>
          <cite>BII</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  "What we're really assessing is things like your keystroke data,
  how fast you move your eyes, how you interact with the interface,
  how many tabs you've got open in your browser ... there are
  around 500 different factors like this that the algorithm detects
  and takes into account when assessing candidates.
</p>
      <p>
  Essentially, he said, the algorithm assesses how people's minds
  work. "Software development is about finding the right
  information quickly, and changing your thinking on the basis of
  new information." On that basis, Catalyte tweaks its
  techie-finding algorithm constantly.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>"What we do isn't charity"</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  This might all sound very noble, but it probably means very
  little to most software development businesses unless it actually
  gets results. Are Catalyte's software development teams really as
  good as teams assembled using traditional hiring methods? For
  Hsu, the answer is that they're better - significantly better, in
  fact.
</p>
      <p>
  "What we do isn't charity," he said. "Our unconventional software
  teams are outperforming traditional software, development teams.
  Our teams are ramping up in one to two sprints, not three to
  four. On average, our teams are three times as productive as
  traditional, tier one software development teams.
</p>
      <p>
  "We're picking extraordinary people like needles from a
  haystack."
</p>
      <p>

  Catalyte Bolsters Growth Trajectory with Two Executive
  Hires</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  These extraordinary people are not all from Silicon Valley,
  either. In fact, within the US, they're not collectively from
  anywhere in particular, which reinforces Hsu's fundamental
  belief: that talent is not concentrated in the major cities.
</p>
      <p>
  "We're proving that you can build software developments teams
  anywhere because talent is evenly distributed across society.
  We're starting up software teams side-by-side with our clients in
  places like Cincinnati, South Carolina, Ohio… we can generate
  proximity [to clients] on-demand."
</p>
      <p>
  "People often ask me 'why is your HQ in Baltimore?'," Hsu added.
  "It's to prove a point. We're proving that software development
  careers need not be confined to degree-holders in San Francisco.
</p>
      <figure>

          <cite>Sean Pavone/Shutterstock</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  He continued: "People imagine all software developers are math
  nerds with four-year degrees. That's not true. They're more like
  self-taught musicians who have practiced. Whereas other companies
  have a preconception of what a successful person looks like, and
  find people to fit that preconception.
</p>
      <p>
  "We've been fast and quiet in terms of growth. Our rivals didn't
  see it coming, But they're catching on to what we're doing, now."
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>Hsu thinks Catalyte could go public within 12
  months</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  Where does Hsu see Catalyte in ten years' time, given its
  seven-fold growth in the last two?
</p>
      <p>
  Hsu suggests an IPO within the next year.
</p>
      <p>
  "We're seriously considering going public," he says. "In the next
  twelve months, I think we'll be well-positioned to do so. That's
  very real.
</p>
      <p>
  "Our ultimate strategy is to blow up pedigree. We want to be like
  the 'Harry Potter' sorting hat of careers, where we take people
  regardless of background and assess their suitability for other
  jobs.
</p>
      <p>
  "Software development is just the first profession we're applying
  our algorithms to. We want to branch out to other professions,
  too."
</p>
      <p>
  Of course, whether Catatlyte achieves its goals remains to be
  seen, but it's already attracted at least one big-name backer.
</p>
      <p>
  In 2018, Catalyte was one of the first companies that billionaire
  AOL co-founder Steve Case invested in as part of his $150 million
  'Rise of Rest' fund, which invests in promising seed-stage
  companies located outside Silicon Valley, New York City, and
  Boston.
</p>
      <p>
  Catalyte's approach to recruitment is a breath of fresh air in an
  industry dominated by white men. If and when it does go public,
  it'll be hoping new shareholders share its appetite for
  diversity.

    <strong>Eric Rosenberg is a former bank manager. When his
    sister started getting a paycheck at his first job, she asked
    him where to put her money.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>They reviewed all of her accounts, and decided the
    right place for her <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/emergency-funds">emergency
    fund</a> was an online <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/high-yield-savings">high-yield
    savings account</a>, where she can earn interest of 2% or more
    - about 200 times what she'd been earning at a traditional
    bank.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Also, her money is readily available in case she needs
    it quickly.</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  After working as a bank manager and more than a decade of writing
  about personal finance, my little sister finally came around and
  asked me for advice on how to handle her money. When she <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-succeed-in-your-first-job-2017-9">
  started her first job and started getting a paycheck</a>, she
  wanted to make sure she was doing things right.
</p>
      <p>
  We sat down and reviewed every financial account she has for a
  major money overhaul. When the makeover was complete, she found
  herself with better accounts that were a better fit for her
  needs. One of the most important financial protections for anyone
  is an emergency fund, and that was one of the first places we
  focused to level up her savings.

      <h2>
  
  Start with a focus on interest rates
</h2>
      <p>
  Before our chat, my sister had her money at a large, traditional
  brick and mortar bank. The problem with using an old-school bank
  for your savings starts with interest. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-yield-savings-account-vs-checking-account-2019-2">
  average interest rate on a savings account</a> at any of the
  largest banks in the US is typically below 0.10%. In some cases,
  you'll get a paltry 0.01%! That's far less than inflation, which
  means you are effectively losing money with this type of account.
</p>
      <p>
  The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-bank-online">best online
  banks</a>, on the other hand, typically offer 2% or more on a
  savings account. If you move from an account that pays 0.01% to
  one that pays 2%, you are getting 200 times more. That is far
  from insignificant.
</p>
      <h2>
  You should never pay a fee for your savings
</h2>
      <p>
  One of the biggest downsides of checking and savings accounts at
  the big banks with physical branches is the fees. Most of these
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/7-ways-to-avoid-checking-account-fees-2012-3">
  accounts charge a fee if you don't meet certain minimum
  requirements</a>.
</p>
      <figure class="op-interactive">
                
                <iframe><script async type='text/javascript' id="myFinance-widget-script">!function(){function e(){var e=document.createElement("script"),n=document.getElementById("myFinance-widget-script"),a=t+"static/widget/myFinance.js";e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src=a,n.parentNode.insertBefore(e,n);var c="myFinance-widget-css";if(!document.getElementById(c)){var d=document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0],i=document.createElement("link");i.id=c,i.rel="stylesheet",i.type="text/css",i.href=t+"static/widget/myFinance.css",i.media="all",d.appendChild(i)}}var t="https://www.myfinance.com/";document.attachEvent?document.attachEvent("onreadystatechange",function(){"complete"===document.readyState&&e()}):document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",e,!1)}();</script><div class="myFinance-widget" data-widget-id="d8c4d306-acaa-4f40-8143-1949a50c55fd" data-campaign="bi-cap-one-aff"></div></iframe>
                
                </figure>
      <p>
  
  Fees are a big money maker for banks, but savvy savers don't pay
  them. My favorite online banks (and most credit unions) don't
  charge any fees for savings accounts with no minimum balance. If
  you're not careful, you'll give the bank more in fees in a month
  than you would get over years of interest at a low rate.
</p>
      <p>
  If you need to withdraw from your emergency fund for a medical
  bill, car repair, or anything else, it is possible you would go
  below the bank's minimum balance to avoid a fee. Her old bank did
  this to her, which was part of her motivation to make a change.
  While the $10 fee may not seem like a big deal, you shouldn't
  have to pay to store your money in a bank. They make money by
  lending it out. Charging savers for going below a minimum balance
  is a terrible practice that I wish would end.
</p>
      <p>
  But for today, you can avoid them by moving to a bank that
  doesn't have minimum balance requirements or other silly fees on
  savings accounts.
</p>
      <h2>
  I told her to put her money in a high-yield savings account
</h2>
      <p>
  Once we finished looking things over, I told my sister she should
  move her emergency fund to either Capital One or Ally. Both banks
  offer competitive interest rates, have no minimum fees, and offer
  excellent customer service. I have banked with both and
  encouraged my sister to choose between the two.
</p>
      <figure class="op-interactive">
                
                <iframe><script async type='text/javascript' id="myFinance-widget-script">!function(){function e(){var e=document.createElement("script"),n=document.getElementById("myFinance-widget-script"),a=t+"static/widget/myFinance.js";e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src=a,n.parentNode.insertBefore(e,n);var c="myFinance-widget-css";if(!document.getElementById(c)){var d=document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0],i=document.createElement("link");i.id=c,i.rel="stylesheet",i.type="text/css",i.href=t+"static/widget/myFinance.css",i.media="all",d.appendChild(i)}}var t="https://www.myfinance.com/";document.attachEvent?document.attachEvent("onreadystatechange",function(){"complete"===document.readyState&&e()}):document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",e,!1)}();</script><div class="myFinance-widget" data-widget-id="d8c4d306-acaa-4f40-8143-1949a50c55fd" data-campaign="bi-cap-one-aff"></div></iframe>
                
                </figure>
      <p>
  
  We looked over the account details together and she decided on
  Ally. The month after she moved the funds, she called me excited
  about earning so much in interest. Every month since, she is far
  out-earning what she would have had at her old bank, and she has
  not paid a fee since.
</p>
      <p>
  I suggested this setup even if she didn't move her checking,
  though both of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/online-banking-how-to-choose-online-bank">
  these banks offer excellent checking accounts</a> as well. In her
  situation, it is unlikely she would need access to her funds in
  less than three business days. In a real emergency, she can pay
  for the cost with her credit card and transfer funds from her
  emergency fund to pay off the bill before the due date, avoiding
  any interest charges.
</p>
      <h2>
  Put your money to work
</h2>
      <p>
  Your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/money-advice-you-shouldnt-ignore-2017-3">
  money is too important to ignore</a>. And while moving funds to a
  new account at a new bank may seem like a hassle, opening an
  account with an online bank is painless in most cases. You can
  open a new savings account at most popular online banks in just a
  few minutes in your pajamas sitting on the couch from your
  smartphone or laptop.
</p>
      <p>
  Even if it took a few hours, which it shouldn't, it would be
  worth it in most cases. With a $5,000 emergency fund, you would
  earn just four cents per month at 0.01%. At 2%, you would take
  home $8.33. Thanks to compounding, the benefit of a higher
  interest account grows every month.
</p>
      <p>
  If you want the same brotherly advice I gave my sister, here it
  is: Get out of a low-interest, high-fee account as fast as you
  can. Just a few minutes of work to pick a new account pays huge
  dividends for years to come.

  But when it comes to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/is-social-security-taxed">Social
  Security</a> - the federal program that pays out monthly
  benefits to disabled and retirement-age Americans - the
  incentive to continue working, or at least to delay benefits, is
  fairly simple: The longer you wait, the more money you'll get.
</p>
      <p>
  The <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html">full retirement age</a> for today's
  workers is between 66 (if born prior to 1960) and 67 (if born in
  1960 or later). That's the age a person who worked at least 10
  years can begin claiming 100% of their Social Security benefit,
  which is equal to an average of monthly wages for their 35
  highest-earning years, adjusted for inflation.

  Anyone can create a free <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/">My Social Security
  account</a> to find out what their pretax monthly
  Social Security benefit will be based on current earnings, and
  see how that could change depending on the date they leave work.
  For those in good health or with a greater chance of longevity,
  it may be worth it to hold out.
</p>
      <p>
  Age 70 is the latest it makes sense to claim Social Security
  benefits. With each 12-month period that benefits are delayed
  beyond a person's full retirement age (up to age 70), their
  benefit increases by up to 8% for a maximum of either 24% for
  those born in 1960 or later or 32% for those born before 1960. 
</p>
      <p>
  The benefit can increase up to age 70, regardless of whether or
  not the person actually retires from work. Still, the highest
  possible Social Security benefit for someone retiring in 2019 is
  <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/legislation/2019%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">$2,849
  a month</a>. You can claim benefits after age 70, but the amount
  will no longer increase.

  Let's say John, who was born in 1955, is in good health and
  enjoys his job. John's full retirement age is <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/1955-delay.html">exactly 66
  and two months</a>, at which point he can claim 100% of his
  monthly Social Security benefit of $1,420 (<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/legislation/2019%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">the
  2019 average benefit</a>). John decides to continue working for a
  few more years, until his 69th birthday, and delays his benefit.
</p>
      <p>
  By the time John claims his Social Security benefit at 69, his
  monthly payout will be $1,742 - <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/1955-delay.html">122.7%</a>
  of his full retirement age benefit. By delaying, John increased
  his monthly Social Security income by about $320. Note that the
  rules are different for spouses - <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/applying7.html">consult the
  Social Security website for details</a>.

  of your Social Security. Here's how to find out exactly how
  much</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  There are several factors to consider if you're weighing whether
  to delay your benefit, but experts say it may be worth it if
  you're able to subsist on other income, such as savings or
  investments or a paycheck from a current job. Usually, delaying
  benefits will be most beneficial for those who expect to live
  into their 80s or longer, but be sure to check out the Social
  Security Administration's <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/otherthings.html">full
  list</a> of things to consider.
</p>
      <p>
  Conversely, you can opt to take Social Security benefits at the
  earliest possible time, age 62, but you'll only receive 75% of
  your full benefit if born before 1960 and 70% of your benefit if
  born in 1960 or later.
</p>
      <p>
  Keep in mind that if you do decide to delay Social Security
  benefits, you'll still become eligible for Medicare at age 65. If
  you don't enroll in <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/what-medicare-covers/what-part-a-covers">Medicare Part A</a> (hospital
  insurance) three months before your 65th birthday, your coverage
  may be delayed or cost more, whether you plan to continue
  working, retire at full retirement age or later, or delay Social
  Security benefits.

    <strong>If you're <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/saving-money">saving
    money</a> you need within a year or two for a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/buying-a-home">big
    purchase like a home</a>, there's a right and a wrong place to
    keep it.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You need somewhere the money is accessible, but
    growing, and not exposed to risk.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>A financial planner says the place that ticks those
    boxes is a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/high-yield-savings">high-yield
    savings account</a>, which has the accessibility of a savings
    account with slow-but-steady growth.</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  If you're saving up for a major purchase, like your first home,
  you're in a delicate position. It's a large amount of money, so
  you want to make sure you can earn interest, but you don't want
  to run the risk of losing your precious savings.
</p>
      <p>
  So where do you keep the money so it grows without risk?
</p>
      <p>
  We asked Brian Face, CFP, CRPC, and founder of Michigan-based
  <a href="https://face2faceplanning.com/">Face 2 Face
  Planning</a>, for advice.
</p>
      <h2>
  The right place to keep your money: high yield savings
</h2>
      <p>
  "If you're buying [a home] or making another large purchase
  within a year to two years," said Face, "you want to put your
  money in a place that will grow some but cannot lose principal." 
</p>
      <p>
  There is a place that does that: the high-yield savings account.
</p>
      <p>
  "I recommend clients put their money for a house in a high-yield
  savings account," Face said - one that earns at least 2%
  interest. Unlike an investment account, he said, this will keep
  your money secure, and give you a nice bonus to help you reach
  your goal faster.
</p>

  If you put $50,000 in a high-yield savings account with 2%
  interest (compounded monthly), at the end of the year you would
  have earned an extra $1,010 - that's a whopping 200 times what
  you'd earn in a big bank savings or checking account with a 0.01%
  interest rate.
</p>
      <p>
  Several <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/online-banking-how-to-choose-online-bank">
  online banks</a> and credit unions offer interest rates above 2%,
  including Ally Bank, which is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/financial-planners-ally-best-high-yield-savings-2019-3">
  a favorite among financial planners</a>. 
</p>
      <p>
  If you know that you won't need that money for a few months, also
  be sure to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/are-cds-a-good-investment">check
  out Certificates of Deposit (CDs)</a> - especially at those
  online banks.

      <p>
  
  CDs allow you to lock in a high interest rate for a fixed time
  period, ranging from three months to five years - typically the
  longer the time period, the higher the interest rate. CD rates
  can be as high as 2.8%, but they won't allow you to withdraw your
  money without penalty for a set period of time, which could be as
  little as three months. 
</p>
      <h2>
  Where not to keep your money: in the the market or in checking
</h2>
      <p>
  Brokerage accounts, which invest your money in the market, are a
  better for long-term investments like retirement, which give you
  time to make up the inevitable losses with gains. But in the
  short term, the market can fluctuate at any time, and you could
  end up losing value at just the wrong moment, without the leeway
  to make it up.
</p>
      <p>
  You also want to avoid keeping that money in a checking account,
  Face said. Besides putting your money at your fingertips where
  it's easiest to spend, checking accounts rarely earn interest.
  Those that do tend to have extra fees or requirements like
  monthly payroll deposits, or a certain number of debit card
  transactions each month.
</p>
      <p>
  Even savings accounts at most banks earn virtually no interest,
  Face continued - often as little as 0.01% APY. With that interest
  rate, that same $50,000 of savings that earned over $1,000 in a
  checking account will earn just $5.00 after an entire year.

  <li>Many Rust Belt cities are littered with empty properties
  after the decline of the US manufacturing industry.
  </li>
  <li>To save themselves from decay, a few cities have developed
  programs that give away homes for a single dollar, provided that
  buyers pick up the renovation costs. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Dollar homes have begun to symbolize just how far Rust
    Belt economies have fallen, but they might also help spur a
    renaissance in forgotten areas.

      <p>
  American cities are divided. While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/books/review/the-new-urban-crisis-richard-florida.html">
  a few large, coastal cities</a> have seen their populations grow,
  economies skyrocket, and major industries expand, other cities in
  the northeast and Midwest look increasingly like
  ghost towns. 
</p>
      <p>
  Go back more than a few decades and that divide wasn't nearly as
  stark. 
</p>
      <p>
  The US manufacturing industry was booming, and factory towns like
  Buffalo and Detroit were considered the economic heart of the
  nation. Today, these cities make up what's called the "Rust Belt"
  - a nod to the <a href="https://beltmag.com/why-rust-belt-matters/">decline of the steel
  industry</a> in the 1980s. 
</p>

  9 cities and towns where you can get a home for free - or buy one
  at a massive discount</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  As the manufacturing industry slowed down, Rust Belt cities lost
  their economic importance, and their populations began to empty
  out. Around 40 years later, <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/04/economic-inequality-geographic-divide-map-census-income-data/586222/">
  the wealth gap</a> between these cities and coastal powerhouses
  <a href="https://www.axios.com/wealth-gap-richest-americans-roaring-twenties-938b8a27-bf7b-4392-b4ae-41b84bef2002.html">
  continues to widen</a>. Many Rust Belt cities are now littered
  with abandoned homes that local governments can't afford to tear
  down.  
</p>
      <p>
  A few of these governments have started selling empty properties
  for a single dollar, provided that the new owners are
  willing to fix them up. In just a short time, dollar home
  programs have begun to symbolize how far Rust Belt economies have
  fallen - but they might also be a ticket to a more prosperous
  future.

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  The programs seem to all follow a similar formula. 
</p>
      <p>
  In Buffalo, New York, the government-run <a href="https://www.buffalony.gov/306/Urban-Homestead-Program">Urban
  Homestead Program</a> sells abandoned properties for $1, plus
  closing costs. Homes that qualify for the program can't have an
  interested buyer or be of use to the public. To
  purchase a dollar home, buyers must agree to stay there for at
  least three years and fix any building code violations within 18
  months.
</p>
      <p>
  Buffalo's program began about four decades ago
  -  around the time that the manufacturing industry collapsed -
  but <a href="https://www.wivb.com/news/local-news/buffalo-homesteaders-buy-house-for-1/1108617505">
  gained significant attention</a> around 2015.
</p>
      <p>
  City officials have said that <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2015/03/03/real_estate/buffalo-1-homes/index.html">
  only a handful of prospective buyers</a> go through with a
  purchase each year. Many others are deterred by renovation costs,
  which are part of the deal in other cities as well.
  
</p>
      <p>
  In Gary, Indiana, the government's dollar home program
  requires buyers to earn at least $35,250 annually and bring the
  home up to "habitable standards" within one year. At the end of
  five years, the city will cede full ownership of the
  property.
</p>
      <figure>

      <p>
  Though renovations are often expensive, they don't
  necessarily exceed the cost of purchasing a new home. 
</p>
      <p>
  In 2017, a housing coordinator for the city's Department of
  Community Development told The Times of Northwest Indiana that
  <a href="https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/lake/gary-offers-homes-for-a-dollar-under-certain-conditions/article_5d3c3167-9501-5cd3-a6b8-89184f23fede.html">
  renovations could cost</a> about $20,000 to $30,000. The <a href="https://www.nwitimes.com/business/lake-newsletter/average-sales-price-of-northwest-indiana-home-has-risen-in/article_0b0a4a1d-7ad3-5365-a283-719a55aed4e9.html">
  average home price in Gary</a> hovers at around $46,000.
</p>
      <p>
  Since 1960, more than half of Gary's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gary-indiana-is-deteriorating-badly-2013-6">
  population has disappeared</a>, leaving about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/us/a-chance-to-own-a-home-for-1-in-a-city-on-the-ropes.html">
  a third of its homes</a> unoccupied or abandoned. At the moment,
  its dollar homes program is limited to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dollar-homes-indiana-fixer-upper-2018-12#it-has-also-maintained-some-surprising-connections-to-hollywood-3">
  just a handful of properties</a>. The city's director of
  communications told Business Insider that the lottery is
  currently closed, and won't open again until the end of the year.
  
</p>
      <p>
  In a larger city like St. Louis, prospective owners have
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/st-louis-cheap-dollar-homes-2019-3">
  a far wider selection</a> of dollar homes. 
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c9ba366569b550dec2f41d6-750-490.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <h1>An abandoned home on Geraldine Ave. in St. Louis.</h1>
          <cite>Google Maps</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  St. Louis' program, which launched earlier this year,
  includes more than 500 vacant single-family properties. To
  qualify for the program, homes must be less than 1,500 square
  feet and have sat in the city's inventory for more than five
  years.
</p>
      <p>
  Like in Buffalo, buyers must commit to occupying the home
  for at least three years, which prevents people from flipping the
  properties right away. They're also expected to
  bring the exterior up to city code in 120 days and renovate the
  entire property in 18 months.
</p>
      <p>
  All told, buyers are out about $400 before renovations have
  begun. In addition to a $25 application fee, buyers are asked to
  obtain a $250 insurance policy and pay for a "homeowners
  counseling class," which teaches them the logistics of owning a
  home. 
</p>
      <p>
  Nearly all of the properties in Gary, St. Louis, and Buffalo have
  incurred major damage, such as peeling walls, broken
  windows, caved-in roofs, and rusted appliances. Many will need to
  be gutted in order to become habitable. 
</p>
      <p>
  The success of these programs will likely depend on whether
  buyers see the homes as a worthwhile investment - or if the
  prospect of massive renovations and hidden costs proves too great
  a burden.  
</p>
      <p>
  For now, the programs provide an opportunity to invest in
  the renaissance of a declining city, in exchange for a place to
  live.

  Sri Lankan security forces have been raiding homes across the

  attacks which killed more than 250 people. 
</p>
      <p>
  Sri Lanka's health ministry <a href="http://www.health.gov.lk/moh_final/english/news_read_more.php?id=650">

  The so-called Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the

    <strong>I left New York a year ago to travel around the world

    <strong>While it would be impossible to pinpoint my favorite

    Ubud, on</strong> the Indonesian island of
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/bali">Bali.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ubud has a bustling community of local Balinese,
    digital nomads, and vacationers exploring rice terraces,
    temples, spiritual retreats, yoga and meditation classes, and
    villas set into the countryside.</strong>

</ul>
      <p>
  A year ago, I left New York to travel the world. In that time,
  I've visited over 20 countries and dozens of cities - everywhere
  from China and Russia to Spain, Portugal, and Bulgaria. Each
  place had its joys and its frustrations.
</p>
      <p>
  In Tanzania, I experienced <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-safari-in-africa-is-like-tanzania-and-serengeti-tips-photos-2019-3">
  some of the most beautiful nature in the world</a>, but it was
  extremely difficult to get to. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-beaches-portugal-algarve-sagres-lagos-where-to-go-2018-9">
  The azure waters of the Atlantic</a> in Portugal were possibly
  the most beautiful place I've ever gone swimming, but it came at
  the price of milling through hordes of British tourists. And when
  I visited Egypt, I got to fulfill my childhood dream of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/great-pyramid-giza-egypt-2019-2">
  seeing the Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the ancient Egyptian
  temples</a>, but I felt like I <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/egypt-tourism-industry-leaves-tourists-frustrated-2018-12">
  had to always be on guard from getting cheated</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  As I look back now, while I can't pinpoint my favorite
  destination of the bunch, I do know which place I would like to
  return to soonest: Ubud, Bali.
</p>
      <p>
  Ubud is a place that could, on paper, be easy to make fun of.
  While it has been known as a
  spiritual and mystical center to Balinese for centuries - Ubud
  means "medicine" - it has sprouted a community of New Agey
  seekers and expats looking to live the good life over the last
  few decades.
</p>
      <p>
  On any given day, you'll encounter digital nomads working on
  startups, Westerners taking sabbaticals to join spiritual
  retreats, Australians starting cafes or co-working spaces, and
  locals living their life amidst it all. A significant percentage
  of the people I met had been to Ubud two, three, or four times.
  Many come every year and some have moved there permanently.
</p>

          <h1>Ubud means "medicine."</h1>
          <cite>Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  When I was there last May, I attended a full-day spiritual
  retreat that included yoga, "ecstatic dance," a cacao ceremony,
  and workshops of "authentic relating." If you can get past the
  privilege that comes with being able to take a few weeks off for
  "self-improvement," it's kind of beautiful how many people come
  to Ubud earnestly to work on themselves and improve their lives
  at retreats like the one I attended.
</p>
      <p>
  For my part, I was skeptical, scoffing at the retreat even as I
  took part in it. But the more I let down my guard and met the
  retreat on its own terms, the more I was rewarded. By the end of
  the day, I felt like I had shaken off a long-held resentment,
  cried twice, and made a few friends that I'm still keeping in
  touch with today. 
</p>
      <p>
  That's kind of the way it goes in Ubud. Someone suggests an
  activity that sounds far out of your comfort zone and you just
  shrug and go, "Why not?"
</p>

          <h1>For outdoorsy folks, there are tons of gorgeous hikes.</h1>

      <h2>
  Best things to do in Ubud
</h2>
      <p>
  One of the joys of visiting Ubud is seeing how Indonesians, local
  Balinese, and expats use the city as their canvas to create
  unique places and experiences. 
</p>
      <p>
  One night while in Ubud, one of my newfound friends suggested we
  go to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BaliDacha/"><strong>Bali
  Dacha</strong>,</a> a Russian-style spa club built around a villa
  estate in the jungle outskirts of Ubud. Set in what feels like a
  giant treehouse, Bali Dacha has multiple saunas, steam rooms,
  pools, and bonfires to hang in and around. The crowd is mostly
  Russians (a dacha is a Russian cottage), with some Europeans,
  Americans, and Aussies mixed in.
</p>
      <p>
  When I visited, there was a dance party going on, but few people
  were drinking. It's one of those Ubud places where, at certain
  points, say, when discussing the rise of global fascism by a
  bonfire with a stranger, making dirty jokes in broken English
  with a group of naked Russians in a sauna, or meeting a model in
  a darkened pool, you ask yourself: Is this real? The blasting
  psychedelic trance music and the Russian guy dancing with a
  Native American headdress does nothing to clear up the confusion.
</p>
      <p>
  Then there is the <strong><a href="https://www.theyogabarn.com/">Yoga Barn</a></strong>, a popular
  retreat center that offers comfortable, accessible classes
  ranging from every kind of yoga discipline to sound healing. To
  give you an idea of the kind of place Ubud is, the most difficult
  place to get into isn't a swanky nightclub, it's the Yoga Barn.
  During peak months, classes like "sound healing" can have lines
  to get in that wrap around the block. I never took it, but every
  person I met that had said the sound healing class was
  "life-changing."
</p>
      <p>
  For outdoorsy folks, there are tons of gorgeous hikes, like the
  <strong><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297701-d2662551-Reviews-Campuhan_Ridge_Walk-Ubud_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html">
  Campuhan Ridge Walk</a></strong>, which takes you along a high
  ridge between two rivers, or a night hike up <strong>Mount
  Batur</strong> to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mount-batur-sunrise-hike-photos-bali-tour-2018-5">
  see one of the most spectacular sunrises</a> in the world. 
</p>
      <p>
  For history buffs and spiritualists, there <a href="http://www.bali-indonesia.com/top10/5-must-see-temples-ubud.htm">
  are tons of temples spread across Ubud</a> and the surrounding
  areas. Some are in the central town, while others are hidden in
  small towns, mountain valleys, and the jungle. 
</p>
      <p>
  One of my favorites to explore was<strong> the Sacred Monkey
  Forest</strong>, a nature reserve housing hundreds of wild
  monkeys. The gorgeous forest and temple complex have been home to
  monkeys for hundreds of years, and the area is considered a holy
  place on the island. When I went, I came within feet of dozens of
  monkeys - and I saw monkeys actually land on top of other
  visitors.
</p>
      <p>
  Ubud is known as a paradise for vegans and raw food eaters, but
  that mostly comes from the expats who have made the city their
  home. The Balinese cook up fresh fish and Indonesian specialties
  in <strong>warungs</strong>, or family-owned restaurants,
  throughout the city. They're worth sampling.
</p>
      <h2>
  Ubud travel tips: Avoid peak tourist season and eat local
</h2>
      <p>
  A word of warning to would-be visitors: Over-tourism is a major problem - the
  number of annual tourists has jumped from <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/lists/beautiful-islands-ruined-by-tourism/">
  2.2 million in 1990 to 13.7 million</a> last year - and the city
  buckles from the weight of it in the peak summer months. The
  traffic of thousands of mopeds and motorbikes chokes the city's
  jungle-lined streets to the point where it can take an hour to
  move a few miles. 
</p>
      <p>
  Many foreigners are beginning
  to work with locals in response to the over-tourism to <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/finding-the-bali-you-came-for">build
  sustainable tourism businesses.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  To mitigate the over-tourism
  when I visited, I came during an off-peak month, stayed a short
  motorbike ride outside the city in an adjacent suburb, and tried
  my best to eat and shop at the various local Balinese owned
  eateries, cafes, and shops. 
</p>
      <p>
  An acquaintance of mine who
  recently visited the city for a few weeks posted a sentiment on
  Facebook that I feel perfectly captures Ubud: "It's so easy to
  get sucked into the Vortex of Ubud. To wonder if you ever need to
  leave this place again. It feels like you don't need to do
  anything except for [sic] wander around just have nice
  conversations with people about how to live a healthier, happier
  life."
</p>
      <p>
  After the week in the city, I
  was no longer questioning why the first thing a taxi driver just
  outside the airport said to me was, "Welcome back. So, how many
  times have you been to Bali?"

      <p>
  Russian national Maria Butina was sentenced to 18 months in
  prison Friday after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy in
  December. She will be deported to Russia after serving her
  sentence.
</p>
      <p>
  Butina admitted to acting as an unregistered agent of the Russian
  government and infiltrating the National Rifle Association (NRA)
  to sway US policy in favor of Russia.
</p>
      <p>
  Before she was sentenced, Butina asked the judge for leniency.
</p>
      <p>
  "My parents discovered my arrest on the morning news they watch
  in their rural house in a Siberian village," Butina said. "I
  loved them dearly, but I harmed them morally and financially.
  They are suffering from all of that. I destroyed my own life as
  well. I came to the United States not under any orders, but with
  hope, and now nothing remains but penitence."
</p>
      <p>
  Butina <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/maria-butina-indicted-russian-national-nra-ties-2018-7">was indicted in July on two
  counts</a> related to conspiracy and acting as an agent of
  the Russian government. The indictment said Butina and a
  high-ranking Russian official, believed to be the Russian
  politician Alexander Torshin, worked to create a "back channel"
  between Russia and the US, using the NRA as a conduit.
</p>
      <p>
  "Butina sought to establish unofficial lines of communication
  with Americans having power and influence over US politics," the
  plea agreement said.
</p>
      <p>
  Butina admitted to drafting a proposal in Russian in March 2015
  called the "Description of the Diplomacy Project," which implied
  that "Russia could use unofficial channels of communication" to
  build relationships with the Republican Party, referred to as
  "Political Party #1" in the document.
</p>
      <p>
  Indeed, Butina has long been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/maria-butina-instagram-documented-accused-russian-spy-life-2018-8">cultivating ties with American
  gun-rights activists</a>, like the Republican strategist
  Paul Erickson, with whom she has been acquainted since at least
  2013. Prosecutors accused Butina of pursuing a sexual
  relationship with Erickson to make inroads with the NRA.
</p>
      <p>
  Erickson is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russian-operative-maria-butina-sentenced-18-months-prison-n998866">
  reportedly the individual</a> denoted as "US Person 1" in an
  affidavit submitted along with the criminal complaint against
  Butina in July. The plea agreement said this person helped Butina
  write her proposal.
</p>
      <p>
  The affidavit said Butina and US Person 1 worked together
  to arrange introductions to other Americans influential in US
  politics, "including an organization promoting gun rights … for
  the purpose of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-russian-fm-tells-pompeo-russians-arrest-unacceptable-2018-7">advancing the agenda of the
  Russian Federation</a>."
</p>
      <p>
  Erickson, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/maria-butina-russian-agent-boyfriend-charged-fraud-2019-2">
  facing federal fraud charges</a> in an unrelated case.
</p>
      <p>
  In a sentencing memo prosecutors submitted in Butina's
  case, they wrote that while Butina was "not a spy in the
  traditional sense," she was still valuable to Russia because she
  was able to help with the "identification of people who have the
  ability to influence policy in a foreign power's favor."
</p>
      <p>
  "This identification could form the basis of other forms of
  intelligence operations, or targeting, in the future," the memo
  said.
</p>
      <p>
  Butina's lawyers, meanwhile, said her activities were
  benign and described them as "friendship citizen
  diplomacy."
</p>
      <p>
  Though they acknowledged that she did not notify the
  Justice Department of her efforts, "her motivations weren't
  nefarious. Maria was genuinely interested in improving relations
  between the two countries, and she had no ill intent."

    <strong>Jeremy Corbyn rejects invite to state banquet with
    Donald Trump set to be hosted by the Queen.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Labour Party leader said that President Trump's
    "racist and misogynistic" views means he should not be honoured
    with a state visit to the United Kingdom.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Corbyn joins a growing list of UK politicians who have
    turned down the invitation.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Trump is due to visit the UK between the 3rd and 5th
    June, 2019.</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  LONDON - Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has turned down an
  invitation from the Queen to attend a state banquet in Buckingham
  Palace with US President Donald Trump.
</p>
      <p>
  In a statement published on Friday, Corbyn said that Prime
  Minister Theresa May should not be "rolling out the red carpet"
  for a president who expresses "racist and misogynistic" views.
</p>
      <p>
  "Theresa May should not be rolling out the red carpet for a state
  visit to honour a President who rips up vital international
  treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and
  misogynist rhetoric," Corbyn said.
</p>
      <p>
  "Maintaining an important relationship with the United States
  does not require the pomp and ceremony of a State Visit. It is
  disappointing that the Prime Minister has again opted to kowtow
  to this US administration."
</p>
      <p>
  However, Corbyn added that he would "welcome" a meeting with
  Trump at another time "to discuss all matters of interest."
</p>
      <p>
  Corbyn is the latest UK politician to reject the invitation for
  the event, set to be hosted by the Queen in June, after it was
  rejected by the Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable and the House
  of Commons speaker John Bercow.
</p>
      <p>
  Cable said that the UK "should not be beguiled by pomp and
  circumstance into hobnobbing with a man who is on record as a
  misogynist and a racist."
</p>
      <p>
  Bercow did not give a reason for his rejection, but has
  previously spoken out against Trump, insisting that he should not
  be allowed to speak in the Houses of Parliament due to his
  bigoted views.
</p>
      <p>
  "I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and sexism
  and our support for equality before the law and an independent
  judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of
  Commons," Bercow said in 2017.

  <li>There's only one week left to get a 100,000-point sign-up
  bonus on the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-boundless-credit-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit
    Card</a>, issued by Chase.
  </li>
  <li>To get the bonus, open a new card before May 2 - this coming
  Thursday - and spend $5,000 within the first three months.
  </li>
  <li>There was a similar offer on the premium version of the card
  - the <strong><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-brilliant-american-express-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant™
    American Express® Card</a></strong> - but that ended this past
    week.
  </li>
  <li>Here's what you need to know about the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-brilliant-american-express-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">
    Marriott Bonvoy Boundless card</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>The introductory 100,000 point welcome bonus on Marriott Bonvoy's premium credit card - the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant AmEx - may be over, but there are still a few more days to snag it on the mainstream card.</p>
      <p>
    If you open the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-brilliant-american-express-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">
    Bonvoy Boundless credit card</a> - issued by Chase - before May
    2, you can earn 100,000 bonus points when you spend $5,000 in
    the first three months.
  </p>
      <p>
    Even though it has a lower fee than the premium <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-brilliant-american-express-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">
    Brilliant</a> card, the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-boundless-credit-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">Marriott Bonvoy Boundless
    Card</a> offers similarly valuable perks.
  </p>
      <p>
    Here are some of the card's benefits.
  </p>
      <p>
    The <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-boundless-credit-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">Bonvoy Boundless</a>
    earns 6x points per dollar spent at participating
    Marriott hotels, and 2x points per dollar spent on everything
    else. That's the same as the premium <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-brilliant-american-express-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">
    Bonvoy Brilliant</a> card, although that one also earns 3x
    points at US restaurants and on flights booked directly with
    the airline.
  </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c758840262898118a70faa6-1334-842.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <cite>Chase</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
    The card also offers a free-night award each year on the
    card-member anniversary. That award can be used at any Marriott
    property that would normally cost up to 35,000 points per
    night.
  </p>
      <p>
    While that award price cap rules out some top properties, there
    are still plenty of places where that award night can be used.
    The premium <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-brilliant-american-express-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">Bonvoy Brilliant</a>
    card's anniversary night can be applied to hotels that
    cost up to 50,000 points per night.
  </p>
      <p>
    Just by having an open <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-boundless-credit-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">Boundless Card</a>, you'll
    automatically get Silver elite status in the Marriott Bonvoy
    loyalty program.
  </p>
      <p>
    Silver doesn't get you much, but it's still something - you'll
    get a 10% bonus on points earned, priority for late checkout,
    access to a dedicated customer service line, free Wi-Fi, and
    more. While it's not a published benefit, you may also be given
    preferential rooms.
  </p>
      <p>
    If you spend $35,000 on the card in a given year, you'll earn
    Gold status instead. That gets you a 25% bonus on points
    earned, complimentary internet during stays, room upgrades
    based on availability, and a small gift of bonus points at
    check-in. You'll also automatically get 15 nights' worth of
    elite-qualifying credit each year, so you'll have an easier
    time achieving Gold status- or higher - with your normal stays.
    The <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-brilliant-american-express-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">Brilliant Card from
    AmEx</a> comes with Gold status by default.
  </p>
      <p>
    No matter which card is better for you - the mainstream
    <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-boundless-credit-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">Bonvoy Boundless Card</a>
    from Chase, or the premium <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/marriott-bonvoy-brilliant-american-express-card/?utm_campaign=bi_bonvoy_boundless_lto_042619&amp;utm_source=referral">
    Bonvoy Brilliant card</a> from AmEx - now is a great time for
    Marriott loyalists to open a new card.
  </p>
      <p>
    But remember: These 100,000-point offers are only available for
    a limited time, so make sure to get them before they're gone!

  directly attack <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">
  former Vice President Joe Biden</a> following his Thursday
  announcement that he's joining the presidential primary. 
</p>
      <p>
  Asked by a reporter on Thursday about a 2005 fight the two had
  over bankruptcy legislation, Warren was clear that she believed
  Biden took the side opposing American families. 
</p>
      <p>
  "I got in that fight because [families] just didn't have anyone
  and Joe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies,"
  Warren said after a rally in Iowa. "It's all a matter of public
  record."
</p>
      <p>
  Warren, then a Harvard law professor, publicly sparred with
  then-Sen. Biden over legislation he supported that made it harder
  for Americans to file for bankruptcy. Warren, a bankruptcy law
  expert, contended that the bill would eliminate crucial
  protections for struggling families, while boosting banks and the
  credit industry.

  Here's where 2020 Democratic presidential candidates stand on
  impeaching Trump</a><strong/></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Warren accused Biden of inserting abortion protections into the
  bill as a way to win Democratic support and called the effort
  "cynical and opportunistic" in a 2002 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/20/opinion/a-quiet-attack-on-women.html">
  New York Times op-ed</a> entitled "A Quiet Attack on Women."
</p>
      <p>
  "Do politicians like Mr. Biden who support the bankruptcy bill
  believe they can give credit-card companies the right to elbow
  out women and children so long as they rally behind an issue like
  abortion?" Warren wrote of the legislation. "The message is
  unmistakable: On an economic issue that attracts millions of
  dollars of industry support, women have no real political
  importance."

  inappropriate touching
  allegations</a><strong/></em>
</p>
      <p>
  A handful of 2020 candidates, including Sens. Bernie Sanders and
  Kamala Harris, and Rep. Beto O'Rourke, sent out fundraising
  emails to their supporters on Thursday with Biden's name in the
  subject line. 
</p>
      <p>
  "As of this morning, my friend Joe Biden is now running for
  president. And you know what I say to that? The more, the
  merrier!" Harris wrote in a message asking her supporters to chip
  in to her campaign.

    <strong>If you're a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/mac">Mac</a> user and
    you're not using Preview to view and edit PDFs, you're missing
    out on a great tool.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Preview has the power to do much more than fill out a
    form. You can add pop-up notes, arrows, shapes, and
    more.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The program also has great image editing
    capabilities.</strong>

      <p>
  Adobe Acrobat is a fine editing
  tool (if you enjoy being pestered with constant updates). But
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/mac">Mac</a>
  users have a built-in alternative that comes with features
  comparable to the free version of Acrobat.
</p>
      <p>
  The list of ways you can
  manipulate a PDF or photo (including JPEG or PNG) in Preview is
  long. Here is just a sampling to get you started.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>How to fill in and sign a form on Preview</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  This is the most basic function
  of a good PDF reader. In Preview, just click on the fillable
  sections and start typing.
</p>
      <p>
  You can also sign a fillable form
  in Preview.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>1.</strong> Open the PDF
  in Preview.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>2.</strong> Click Tools
  &gt; Annotate &gt; Signature.
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc31262b14bf4055e6d8ea2-480-345.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <h1>You can insert your signature into PDF documents.</h1>
          <cite>Laura McCamy/Business Insider</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  <strong>3.</strong> If you've
  already added a signature to Preview, it will appear in a pop-up
  box. Click your signature to add it, then drag it to the
  appropriate spot on the form.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>4.</strong> If you don't
  have a signature or want to create a new one, click "Manage
  Signatures." A window will appear that allows you to create a
  signature on your trackpad, or scan one with your camera. Once
  you are satisfied, click "Done" and your signature is
  saved.
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc3121fd1a2f85e79701fa3-320-369.jpg"/>

          <h1>You can create a signature with your trackpad, or by scanning one with your computer's camera.</h1>
          <cite>Laura McCamy/Business Insider</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  One caveat: If you save a
  fillable form and send it to someone who will open it in Acrobat,
  Acrobat may see your entries on the form. You can get around this
  by printing and scanning the document or by printing to
  PDF.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>How to annotate a PDF in Preview</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  There are numerous ways you can
  edit a PDF in Preview. Most of the editing tools are found under
  Tools &gt; Annotate.
</p>
      <p>
  You can add text, arrows,
  circles, rectangles, and more. To customize these annotations,
  click the appropriate icon on the menu above the document.
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>
    Change the thickness of a line
    by clicking the line icon. A menu of line options will drop
    down.
  </li>
  <li>
    To change the color of an
    arrow, shape, or line, click the outline icon. A color palette
    will pop down. Click on the color you want.
  </li>
  <li>
    To change the fill of a shape,
    click the box icon. A color palette appears. For no fill,
    choose the white box with a red line across it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the text icon to change
    the font, size, alignment, or style of added text. To change
    the text color, click the color box on the upper right side of
    the font box. A color palette will pop down.
  </li>
</ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc3129e4a16757e1a62eec2-320-277.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <h1>Preview allows you to change the color of most annotations.</h1>
          <cite>Laura McCamy/Business Insider</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  You can annotate text that's
  already in the document with options such as highlight,
  strikethrough, and underline. Simply place your cursor on the
  text you want to annotate. Choose Tools &gt; Annotate to see your
  options.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>How to edit a photo in Preview</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  You can annotate a photo with the
  same tools you can use on a regular PDF. In addition, you can
  flip a photo horizontally or vertically, crop it, or adjust the
  size.
</p>
      <p>
  To change the orientation of a
  photo, the tools menu gives you options to rotate or flip the
  image. If you want to adjust the size, choose Tools &gt; Adjust
  Size. Size adjustment comes in handy if your image is too large
  to send or add to a social media profile.
</p>
      <p>
  Here are the steps to crop a
  photo:
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>1.</strong> Place your
  cursor at one of the corners where you want to start
  cropping.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>2.</strong> Drag your
  cursor until the dotted line is the size you want to crop.
</p>

          <cite>Laura McCamy/Business Insider</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  <strong>3.</strong> Choose Tools
  &gt; Crop. This option will be grayed out until you have set the
  crop area.
</p>
      <p>
  You can undo any of these changes
  in Preview by choosing Edit &gt; Undo. You also have the option
  to revert to an earlier version of the image or PDF. Just click
  File &gt; Revert To. A box will pop out showing you previous
  saved versions of the document.

    <strong>Ally Bank and Better.com announced a deal last week in
    which the bank will outsource most of its mortgage operations
    to the fintech start-up. </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ally is also investing $20 million in Better, valuing
    the company at $550 million. </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>In addition to capital, the deal provides Better access
    to billions in loan volume and connects it with a national
    brand whose reputation is staked on being an ethical, consumer
    friendly alternative to traditional banks</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">Visit Business Insider's
    homepage for more stories.</a>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  On a panel at a consumer
  finance conference in March, Better.com founder and CEO Vishal
  Garg gave a nod to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/banks-are-offloading-mortgages-to-startups-2019-4">
  industry trends</a> that have cracked open the mortgage business
  for start-ups like his. 
</p>
      <p>
  "A lot of the banks have
  been getting out of the mortgage industry, and that's great,"
  said Garg, whose company up until this point has offered its
  home-loan service - which trims preapproval down to mere minutes
  with the help of machine learning and automation - directly to
  consumers, rather than selling its tools to banks.
</p>
      <p>
  Now, Garg and Better.com
  are working directly with the banks after inking a deal with
  online-lender Ally Bank. 
</p>
      <p>
  As part of the partnership,
  announced last week, Ally is outsourcing its mortgage operations
  to Better. Prospective homebuyers will apply and move through the
  process on a site with an Ally-branded body and the start-up's
  powerful engine on the inside.
</p>
      <p>
  But Ally isn't just getting
  a spiffy new mortgage platform, it's also buying a larger stake
  in Better.com. 
</p>
      <p>
  As part of the deal, Ally
  is increasing its stake in Better to $20 million as an add-on to
  the start-up's <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/better-mortgage-secures-70-million-in-series-c-funding-from-american-express-ventures-and-the-healthcare-of-ontario-pension-plan-300786971.html">
  $75 million series C funding round</a> earlier this year,
  according to multiple sources familiar with the deal.
  
</p>
      <p>
  The investment values
  Better, which Garg founded in 2014, at $550 million, the sources
  said. 
</p>
      <p>
  Better declined to comment
  on the terms of deal. An Ally spokeswoman disputed the
  figures.
</p>
      <p>

  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/banks-are-offloading-mortgages-to-startups-2019-4">
  Bitten by regulatory headaches and sagging profits, banks are
  offloading their home loan businesses to machine-powered
  start-ups</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Ally's brand and 8 million
  customers may prove more valuable than the additional capital,
  though. 
</p>
      <p>
  Better
  originated $1.3 billion in
  mortgages in 2018 across 30 states. That's triple what the
  company did the year before, but it's a drop in the
  multi-trillion mortgage bucket.
</p>
      <p>
  At the March conference,
  Garg didn't hide his frustration that the business wasn't
  catching fire quicker customers. 
</p>
      <p>
  Even though Better offered
  the lowest mortgage rate, 80% of customers approved on its
  platform elected to take their business elsewhere, paying 0.5%
  more on their rate and leaving $1,500 a year on the table,
  according to Garg's estimates.
</p>
      <p>
  "We just need to figure out
  a way to bridge that trust chasm," Garg said. 
</p>
      <p>
  The partnership with Ally,
  which since its post-crisis rebrand <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/31963049">has billed</a> itself as the
  ethical, <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/IpC5/ally-bank-two-star-dentist">consumer
  friendly alternative</a> to traditional banks, could help
  alleviate that frustration, in addition to providing access to
  millions of more customers and billions in additional loan volume
  each year.
</p>

                </figure>
      <p>
  Better will start by handling Ally's mortgage business in nine
  states, roughly 20% of its flow, and aims to ramp up to 100% by
  the end of the year.
</p>
      <p>
  The company said it expects to reach $3 billion of mortgage
  originations in 2019.

  <li>Jobs in the cannabis industry are growing rapidly, according
  to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">The
  New York Times</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Though specific job metrics are not yet tracked, sites like
  ZipRecruiter and Indeed report 200,000 to 300,000 jobs in pot
  nationwide. Glassdoor <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/cannabis-talent-heats-up/">reported</a>
  a 76% increase in cannabis job openings earlier this year.
  </li>
  <li>The influx in marijuana jobs has led to university programs
  dedicated to learning about cannabis, as well as lessened
  workplace drug testing to compete for more talent.

  Jobs in pot might be at an all-time high, according to a new
  report.
</p>
      <p>
  The cannabis industry has one of the fastest-growing rates of job
  creation, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/business/economy/jobs-in-cannabis-weed-marijuana.html">
  The New York Times</a>. While the US Department of Labor does not
  provide a specific number of jobs created, job-listing sites like
  Indeed and ZipRecruiter reported as many as 200,000 to 300,000
  new jobs in the cannabis industry nationwide. Glassdoor saw a
  <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/cannabis-talent-heats-up/">76%
  increase</a> in job openings in December 2018 compared to that
  time last year, according to a separate <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/cannabis-talent-heats-up/">report</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  Jobs in the cannabis industry primarily consist of low-paying
  agricultural and retail work, but demand for high-paying
  positions like chemists, software engineers, and nurses have
  increased, The Times reports. Professional and technical roles
  account for nearly half of available job openings on Glassdoor as
  of last year. 
</p>
      <p>
  "As the cannabis industry becomes more legitimate, more and
  more professional roles will be in demand to help businesses
  comply with tax laws and regulations and scale into larger
  markets," <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/cannabis-talent-heats-up/">Glassdoor
  stated in its report</a>.

  US workers are failing drug tests at an incredible rate - but
  legal weed has the future of these screenings in doubt</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  The influx of pot jobs has created shifts in workplace culture.
  Just as marijuana use among US workers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/marijuana-use-is-on-the-rise-among-us-workers-study-finds-2019-4">
  hit a 14-year high</a>, New York City became the first major
  municipality to approve a bill <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-future-of-marijuana-drug-testing-at-work-2019-4">
  barring forced drug testing in some industries</a>. Companies
  from banks to automakers are now forced to re-think drug testing
  so as not to scare away talented employees who may enjoy a
  (legal) joint every now and then, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-future-of-marijuana-drug-testing-at-work-2019-4">
  employers told Business Insider</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  Schools are even <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cannabis-jobs-college-courses-marijuana-2019-4">
  gearing up to prepare students for jobs in the marijuana
  industry</a>. Colleges in New York, Colorado, California, and
  Michigan now offer cannabis-specific courses.
</p>
      <p>
  Some companies wasted no time embracing the new marijuana normal.
  <a href="https://keytocannabis.com/">Key to Cannabis</a>, a
  Denver-based company dedicated to reviewing pot products, ditched
  beer and wine at company happy hours for edibles and joints.
</p>
      <p>
  "I prefer CBD products during the day, and then when I'm
  unwinding for more of a happy-hour-style relaxation I will
  definitely imbibe THC," Key to Cannabis co-founder told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/workers-unwind-with-office-weed-happy-hours-2019-4">
  Business Insider reporter Ivan De Luce</a>. "I prefer joints
  myself, but I know everyone on our team has a different
  preference."

  <li>Amid mounting industry pressures, banks are increasingly
  outsourcing home lending to the machines.
  </li>
  <li>In recent years giants like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase
  have handed off key components of their mortgage businesses to
  scrappy tech start-ups armed with data and machine-learning
  capabilities.
  </li>
  <li>Last week, online-only Ally Bank became the latest entry in
  this chapter, announcing it was outsourcing most of its mortgage
  operation to Better.com.
  </li>
  <li>With competition intensifying and margins thinning, a
  top-flight digital-mortgage offering is becoming a standard
  requirement, and banks without one risk falling behind and ceding
  market share.

      <p>
  The business of buying a home has long been the dominion of
  banks, requiring time and human interaction. But amid mounting
  industry pressures, home lending is being delegated to the
  machines.
</p>
      <p>
  In recent years, banks have been handing off key components of
  their mortgage businesses to scrappy tech start-ups armed with
  data and algorithms, betting they'll be able to trim costs or
  sharpen a competitive edge in an industry reckoning with
  heightened competition, regulatory headaches, and thinning
  margins.
</p>
      <p>
  Wells Fargo <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-u-s-bank-turn-to-startup-to-speed-up-mortgage-applications-1503572580">
  has turned to Blend</a>, a startup offering lenders a platform
  fortified by machine learning that automates and
  streamlines home loans into a smartphone friendly setup. JPMorgan
  Chase last year enlisted Roostify, a Blend competitor, to build a
  "digital, self-service mortgage platform," as did TD Bank.
  
</p>
      <p>
  "Machine learning" and "automation" have become gimmicky
  buzzwords in some corners, but in home lending it's fast becoming
  a basic competitive requirement. Banks without a top-flight
  digital mortgage offering risk falling behind and ceding market
  share.
</p>
      <p>
  And it's not just branch-heavy behemoths turning to fintechs for
  help - even seemingly more nimble online banks are outsourcing
  their mortgage operations.  
</p>
      <p>
  Last week, digital-only Ally Bank became the latest entry in this
  chapter, announcing during its quarterly earnings call a
  partnership with Better.com, a start-up formerly known as Better
  Mortgage. 
</p>
      <p>
  Better is carving out turf in the same field as Blend and
  Roostify, offering a streamlined mortgage experience, including
  preapproval for a home loan in minutes through its website. But
  up until this point it has offered its services directly to
  consumers, rather than selling its tools to banks.
</p>

          <cite>Better</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  Come June, Better will start taking over Ally's mortgage
  operation. The start-up will carry the process end-to-end,
  originating, approving, underwriting, and closing on mortgages.
  The loans will be issued in Ally's name, and the bank will retain
  some on its balance sheet and others will be sold into the
  marketplace.

  Digital mortgage start-up Better.com is now worth $550 million
  following a new investment from Ally Bank</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  In other words, even one of the largest and <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/best-online-banks/">highest-rated
  online banks</a> in the US is offloading most of its mortgage
  business to an upstart with more digital sophistication in an
  effort to gain ground in the challenging home-lending market. 
</p>
      <h2>
  The mortgage business has become a slog
</h2>
      <p>
  It's no secret the mortgage business has become a slog for the
  big banks: Industry giants <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/falling-home-sales-could-signal-us-recession-2019-1">
  posted hefty declines</a> in mortgage revenues and originations
  in 2018, and the first quarter of 2019 provided no respite. 
</p>
      <p>
  At Wells Fargo, the largest home lender, originations fell 23%
  and mortgage income declined 24% to $708 million compared with
  the first quarter of 2018. JPMorgan Chase, the next largest bank
  lender, saw originations fall 18% in the first quarter while
  income and fees dropped 15% to $396 million.
</p>
      <p>
  The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-chase-investor-slide-explains-mortgage-business-slump-2019-2">
  sources of sagging profits</a> are manifold - intense competition
  from nonbank lenders, more rules and scrutiny from regulatory
  authorities, increased costs, and weaker consumer appetite.
</p>
      <p>
  In his <a href="https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2018/ar-ceo-letters.htm?a=1">
  annual letter to shareholders</a>, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon
  groused about the mortgage business, noting that "banks are under
  constant pressure" to make home loans, and that they take the
  heat and scrutiny when something goes awry, even when their
  underwriting passes muster. 
</p>
      <p>
  "We are intensely reviewing our role in originating,
  servicing and holding mortgages. The odds are increasing that we
  will need to materially change our mortgage strategy going
  forward," Dimon wrote in the letter, adding that
  regulatory requirements have made owning mortgages "hugely
  unprofitable" for banks. 
</p>
      <p>
  Dimon's pain has been Better's gain, as fintechs and other
  industry challengers have seized on the opening. 
</p>
      <p>
  "A lot of the banks have
  been getting out of the mortgage industry, and that's great,"
  Better founder and CEO Vishal Garg said on a panel at a consumer
  finance conference in March. 
</p>
      <p>
  But most major banks
  haven't completely capitulated, but rather they've teamed up with
  a digital provider to gain an edge.
</p>
      <p>
  Or, like Bank of America,
  which <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/47134-wells-fargo-bank-of-america-reveal-true-impact-of-digital-mortgages">
  anticipates 50% of its mortgage applications</a> will be digital
  in 2019, they've built a <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/digital-mortgage-experience/">
  competitive offering in house</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  Ally's situation is a
  little different than giants like Wells, JPMorgan, and Bank of
  America, as it's still a comparatively small player challenging
  for a bigger piece of the pie.
</p>
      <p>
  But they face the same
  headwinds and stiff competition as their brick-and-mortar peers,
  many of which, perhaps ironically, now have digital mortgage
  offerings more sophisticated than their own. 
</p>
      <p>
  The firm - formerly the
  finance arm of General Motors until a post-crisis overhaul and
  rebrand - reentered the home-lending business in 2016 after
  <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/ally-reports-successful-move-away-mortgages">
  largely retreating from mortgages in 2012</a>. At $186 million in
  revenues, 3% of the firm's total, the mortgage division is a
  small but growing business at Ally, which has $180 billion in
  assets. 
</p>
      <p>
  Currently, applying through their digital mortgage process
  involves filling out a form on the Ally website or app and
  waiting for a call from a company representative, who then
  manually enters in more info into the system to complete the
  application. Compared with machine-learning powered approaches
  that trim preapproval down to mere minutes entirely online, the
  application process isn't much more advanced than driving over to
  your local bank branch.
</p>
      <p>
  Other parts of the loan process are outsourced to a <a href="https://media.ally.com/2016-12-12-Ally-Broadens-Product-Portfolio-with-the-Launch-of-Ally-Home-Mortgage-Offering">
  separate company called LenderLive</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  But after Better takes over in June, prospective homebuyers will
  apply and move through the
  process on a site with an Ally-branded body and the start-up's
  powerful engine on the inside.
</p>
      <p>
  Better will start by handling Ally's mortgage business in nine
  states, roughly 20% of its flow, and aims to ramp up to 100% by
  the end of the year.
</p>
      <p>
  As part of the deal, the bank is also upping its investment in
  Better to $20 million, according to multiple sources familiar
  with the deal, which <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/better-is-worth-550-million-following-a-fresh-20-million-investment-2019-4">
  values the start-up at $550 million</a>. 
</p>
      <p>
  Ally believes its partnership with Better will put the digital
  bank back on the cutting edge.
</p>
      <p>
  The new experience "will be truly a differentiating factor," Ally
  CFO Jennifer LaClair said in the earnings call, adding that she
  expects it will also help the bank shed costs and become more
  efficient. 
</p>
      <p>
  Given the direction the mortgage industry is moving, this type of
  digital lending capability may soon become status quo rather than
  a differentiator. But banks without it may quickly find
  themselves surrendering a business that they dominated for
  decades.

      <p>
  The standout feature on Apple's next-generation iPhone is
  expected to be its rumored triple-lens camera. Now, we're getting
  an idea of what that camera might look like and how it might
  affect the iPhone's design.
</p>
      <p>
  Prolific gadget leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1121671490078797824">Steven
  Hemmerstoffer</a>, who has a reputation for digging up often
  credible details about upcoming smartphones, collaborated with
  blog <a href="https://cashkaro.com/blog/exclusive-iphone-xi-renders-video/106205">
  CashKaro</a> to create renders of what could be the next iPhone's
  design.
</p>
      <p>
  The most notable change is a large rounded square on the phone's
  back panel where three cameras are placed in a triangular
  pattern. The image aligns with other reportedly leaked photos
  that claim to show the iPhone's back panel, such as <a href="http://www.slashleaks.com/l/iphone-xi-schematics-leaked">this one that recently surfaced on the
  Slash Leaks</a> and other photos previously tweeted by
  Hemmerstoffer.
</p>
      <p>
  If accurate, the images signal a major departure from Apple's
  current approach when it comes to camera design. The iPhone XS
  Max and iPhone XS both feature a dual camera setup with one lens
  located above the other, resulting in a shape that resembles a
  thin, elongated oval. Based on the new leak, it appears that
  Apple will dedicate much more space on the device's back panel to
  this camera setup.

  <em><strong>Read more</strong>:</em> <em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-2019-iphones-rumors-point-to-super-wide-angle-camera-2019-4">Here's more evidence that Apple's
  2019 iPhones will come with one of the Galaxy S10's best
  features</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  The third camera on the next iPhone is expected to enable wider
  field-of-view when taking photos similar to the ultra-wide-angle
  lens on Samsung's Galaxy S10, as reports from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-30/apple-is-said-to-prep-new-3-d-camera-for-2020-iphones-in-ar-push">
  Bloomberg</a> and TF International Securities <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-2019-iphones-rumors-point-to-super-wide-angle-camera-2019-4">
  analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> have indicated. 
</p>
      <p>
  The addition of a third camera is necessary for Apple's iPhone to
  remain competitive with flagship Android phones. At a time when
  smartphone upgrades bring incremental changes, like bigger
  screens and faster processors, the camera has emerged as being a
  key differentiator for major smartphone makers. The Galaxy S10's
  triple-lens camera is one of the phone's buzziest features, for
  example, and Google <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/night-sight-camera-update-for-pixel-3-is-awesome/">
  earned accolades</a> at the end of last year for its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-pixel-3-night-sight-camera-mode-availability-how-it-works-2018-11">
  Night Sight feature</a> on the Pixel 3. 
</p>
      <p>
  Other than a new triple-lens camera, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-iphones-from-apple-2019-rumors-features-specs-2019-3">
  next iPhone is expected to feature</a> reverse wireless charging
  - another feature already available <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-iphone-features-the-galaxy-s10-already-has-2019-4">
  on the Galaxy S10</a> - improved facial recognition and a frosted
  glass design. Apple's iPhone launches are always closely watched,
  but this year's launch will be particularly important as the
  company grapples with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-q1-2019-earnings-iphone-sales-revenue-eps-analysis-2019-1">
  slowing smartphone sales.</a> In its January earnings report, the
  company said iPhone sales for the holiday quarter fell by 15%,
  compared to same period one year ago. 
</p>
      <p>
  Hemmerstoffer has a solid track record when it comes to correctly
  predicting details about new Apple products. In 2016, for
  example, he tweeted photos of the iPhone 7's back panel that
  ended up looking just like the real thing. When <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/onleaks-steve-hemmerstoffer-interview-about-iphone-leaks-2016-7">
  speaking with Business Insider</a> in 2016, he said he has a
  network of sources throughout the production line that consists
  of subcontractors, telecommunications companies, and accessory
  makers. 
</p>
      <p>
  That being said, leaks don't always reflect the final product,
  even if they do come from a reliable place. "As I often say, the
  leaking game isn't an exact science," Hemmerstoffer said in 2016.
  "There is no flawless leaker and even the best fails sometimes.
  That's part of the game, we all have to deal with it."

      <ul>
  <li>Complex Networks benefited from Verizon's big bet on digital
  video when it gave the company an estimated $150 million to make
  series for mobile video service Go90.
  </li>
  <li>Verizon shut down Go90 a year ago, forcing Complex to reset
  its goals.
  </li>
  <li>But Complex was able to find its footing because it already
  had an established video audience, it got to keep the Go90 shows,
  and its series are evergreen and have a long shelf life.

</ul>
      <p>
  Three years ago, Complex Networks was riding high.
</p>
      <p>
  Verizon and Hearst had just teamed up to buy the sneaker- and hip
  hop culture-focused media company. Verizon wanted to use
  Complex's digital video know-how to serve young men ad-supported
  entertainment on their mobile phones. It paid Complex Networks
  well - roughly $150 million, according to two sources close to
  the situation - to produce shows that would appear on Go90, a new
  video service where young people could watch shows on their phone
  for free from the likes of HuffPost, Vice, and AwesomenessTV.

  'We're an anomaly': Complex Networks ignored the digital media
  playbook, and now it's set to have another profitable year with
  at least $200 million in revenue</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  In June 2018, Verizon shut down Go90 after less than three years
  after it failed to take off, forcing Complex Networks to adjust
  its goals.
</p>
      <p>
  "We were disappointed," Complex CEO Rich Antoniello told Business
  Insider of the Go90 shutdown. "Obviously we would have loved to
  have continued to be a strategic partner. It would have been a
  tremendous play for us long term to have this funding resource
  and audience discovery platform for younger consumers from a
  mobile perspective.
</p>
      <p>
  "We had to be beholden to ourselves faster than we had originally
  planned. Trying to replace a great deal of capital is hard
  because we're going to have to do it from multiple outlets. It
  probably added an extra 12 to 18 to 24 months to some of the
  longer-term, larger scale goals."
</p>
      <p>
  Few media companies have been able to make a sustainable,
  profitable business through digital video. The fall of Defy
  Media, Awesomeness, and Go90, are just a few examples of
  companies that the pivot to video has claimed.
</p>
      <p>
  In this respect, Complex stands out. It's been profitable since
  2010 and is on track to be in the black again. Antoniello said
  revenue will be up close to 20% this year. Multiple sources said
  it's on track to make at least $200 million in revenue this year.
</p>
      <p>
  Complex landed on its feet for a few reasons, according to 
  Antoniello.
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>Complex had been creating long-form video series designed to
  be distributed on many platforms since 2012, and was doing so
  profitably. 
  </li>
  <li>Complex got ownership of the shows it made for Go90. The
  money enabled Complex to do more upscale series than the kinds of
  shows it was known for, like "Hot Ones," where host Sean Evans
  gets celebrities to eat progressively hotter chicken wings. With
  the Go90 money, Complex worked with "Friday Night Lights"
  director Peter Berg on a docu-series "QB1"; and made
  "Thanksgiving," which was created by Dan Powell and Bethany Hall
  and starring Chris Elliott and Amy Sedaris.
  </li>
  <li>Complex is still 50%-owned by Verizon, and there are also
  opportunities to distribute video content with Verizon's media
  arm, home to Yahoo and AOL, Antoniello said. "It's a sunk cost
  for us," he said. "We're already positive from a profitability
  perspective by selling the percentage we've sold. I don't want to
  say we're playing with house money, but we can afford to be very
  strategic about it."
  </li>
  <li>The type of shows Complex makes are evergreen, unlike news
  shows, which makes it easier to license them again and again.
  </li>
</ul>
      <h2>
  Complex has found distributors for more than half its Go90 shows
</h2>
      <p>
  So far, Complex has distributed a little more than half the 50
  shows it made for Go90. Of those, it licensed 10 to Netflix (such
  as "QB1" and "Inst@famous") and Hulu. Others went to a content
  provider and cable network that Complex wouldn't disclose yet.
  Antoniello said Complex already made a profit by distributing
  Go90 shows, which means he doesn't have to take the first deal
  that comes along to monetize the remainder.
</p>
      <p>
  Didn't Complex have to lay people off when the Go90 money went
  away? It's true Complex's staff is down to 300 from around 400 in
  2017. Most of the reduction came from people who worked for
  now-defunct RatedRed.com and Seriously.TV, two digital media
  properties that Hearst and Verizon created for millennials and
  which had been absorbed by Complex.
</p>
      <p>
  Complex also has to go out and license its remaining shows to
  other platforms, which takes time.
</p>
      <p>
  But in contrast with Awesomeness, whose fortunes were tied to
  Go90 and which sold to Viacom for $50 million, down from a
  one-time implied value of $650 million, Complex is in a good
  situation, Antoniello said.
</p>
      <p>
  "All it did was jumpstart us in the premium content development
  space and allow us to fulfill our strategy faster than we would
  have," he said of the Go90 money. "It was an accelerant - it was
  not part of the core overall."

    <strong>Alongside the long-anticipated launch of "<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/avengers-endgame-is-even-better-than-infinity-war-2019-4">Avengers:
    Endgame</a>," Google has added a Thanos-themed Easter egg to
    its search engine.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Activating the Easter egg is far simpler than putting
    together an Infinity Gauntlet: Just Google the term
    "Thanos."</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>If you haven't seen "Avengers: Infinity War," maybe
    don't do this.</strong>

</ul>
      <p>
  The main bad guy in "Avengers: Endgame" - and across the last
  several movies - is a large alien named Thanos.
</p>
      <p>
  Perhaps you've heard of him? He's kind of a big deal, both
  literally and figuratively.
</p>
      <p>
  More than just being a well-known antagonist, Thanos is notorious
  for a particularly heinous act in "Avengers: Infinity War." And
  that act is now tied to a very silly Google Easter egg.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Spoilers ahead: If you've yet to see "Infinity War"
  and don't want to have it massively spoiled, now is the time to
  turn away.</strong></em>

  If you type "Thanos" into Google search, you might notice a
  particularly familiar golden, bejeweled glove appearing in the
  results.
</p>
      <p>
  It looks like this:

      <p>
  Hey, why's the Infinity Gauntlet here on Google? 
</p>
      <p>
  Turns out it's a clickable item - and it acts very much like
  Thanos' version of the gauntlet, in that it starts vaporizing
  search results like so many superheroes at the end of "Infinity
  War."

    faced backlash when it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-new-rewards-levels-spark-backlash-2019-4">
    launched its new rewards program</a> earlier in April, with
    some of its most loyal customers complaining about changes. 
  </li>
  <li>Roz Brewer, the president of Starbucks' US business, said
  that that the changes aim to make the rewards program more
  accessible, as Starbucks tries to win over less frequent
  customers. 
  </li>
  <li>Brewer also said that the volume of calls Starbucks has
  received regarding the changes is lower than the company
  expected.

  Starbucks' new rewards program has been controversial among some
  of the chain's biggest fans. 
</p>
      <p>
  In mid-April, Starbucks debuted a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-new-rewards-levels-spark-backlash-2019-4">
  new program</a> in which members no longer had to reach a certain
  benchmark to become a "gold" member, eligible to earn rewards.
  Under the new tiered rewards system, customers can get
  rewards more quickly, with the option to make minor
  customizations for free in exchange for 25 stars.
</p>
      <p>
  However, some of the most popular rewards - such as
  Starbucks' lattes, macchiatos, and other handcrafted drinks - now
  require 150 stars, an increase from the old program. The change
  has sparked backlash with claims of stars being "devalued."
  
</p>
      <p>

  Starbucks infuriates customers by changing its rewards program,
  making it more expensive to get some of the most popular
  rewards</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  In response to an analyst's question about customers'
  response to the new rewards program on Thursday, Starbucks' US
  President Roz Brewer said that the chain wanted to make its
  rewards program more accessible. 
</p>
      <p>
  "The first rewards comes at 25 starts after two to three
  visits," Brewer said. "In the past, your first free reward would
  have come after 30 to 40 ... visits. And so, this is an
  opportunity for us to start our customers out and earning and
  redeeming stars right away." 
</p>
      <p>
  Brewer also said that the company has been closely
  monitoring member calls to call centers. While she acknowledged
  there have been calls about the new program, she said that as of
  Thursday, the volume of calls was "well below our forecast."
  
</p>
      <p>
  "We've also been monitoring social media as well. And, if
  you are comparing this to times in the past when we made these
  transitions, these are significantly lower responses from our
  customers," Brewer continued.
</p>
      <p>
  Starbucks' rewards program is a crucial part of the company's
  business. On Thursday, the company reported that the program had
  16.8 million active members, an increase of 13% year-over-year.
</p>

  Starbucks still needs to solve a massive problem, as analysts
  worry about 'anemic' traffic</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  With the revamped program, Starbucks aims to better engage
  casual, less frequent customers. 
</p>
      <p>
  "Through a new tiered redemption system, the program will
  meaningfully increase the rewards yield for 'entry-level'
  customers while reducing the yield for its more premium members,"
  Mizuho analyst Jeremy Scott wrote in a note earlier in April.
</p>
      <p>
  Scott continued: "The move is a reversal of sorts from the 2016
  transition, which benefited larger spenders, but it's in concert
  with the company's strategy to grow frequency among its more
  casual customers."

      <ul>
  <li>"Avengers: Endgame" made a record-breaking $60 million in
  Thursday preview screenings.
  </li>
  <li>It passed previous record holder "Star Wars: The Force
  Awakens" ($57 million).
  </li>
  <li>"Endgame" is projected to make over $950 million globally in
  its opening weekend, and may get to $300 million domestically.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  There have been huge box-office hits in the past - "Titanic,"
  "Avatar," "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," "Avengers: Infinity
  War" - that brought in record-breaking amounts of coin, but none
  of those had an opening weekend like "Avengers: Endgame" is
  having. 
</p>
      <p>
  The latest release from Disney/Marvel Studios has already brought
  in an astounding $60 million in its Thursday preview run,
  <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/box-office-avengers-endgame-hits-record-60m-previews-1204963?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral">according to The Hollywood
  Reporter</a>. That beats the all-time record held by "The Force
  Awakens" of $57 million.
</p>
      <p>
  By Sunday, "Endgame" could have a global haul of $950 million,
  including a $300 million domestic take.
</p>
      <p>
  Earlier this week, the movie opened in China, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/avengers-endgame-has-biggest-china-box-office-opening-of-all-time-2019-4">
  taking in over $107 million</a>. That was the biggest opening
  ever for a Hollywood film in the Middle Kingdom.

  MoviePass competitor Sinemia shut down operations in the US as
  "Avengers: Endgame" enters theaters</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  In the US, the nation's largest chain, AMC, is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/avengers-endgame-amc-theaters-open-24-hours-a-day-opening-weekend-2019-4">
  keeping some of its theaters open 24 hours a day this weekend</a>
  to accommodate the huge demand to see "Endgame." In fact,
  according to AMC, the movie will be shown in its theaters
  approximately 58,000 times this weekend - 10,000 more than the
  previous record held by "Infinity War."
</p>
      <p>
  Meanwhile, the movie is Fandango's biggest presales movie ever,
  selling five times as many tickets in its first week of presales
  for "Endgame" as were sold for "Infinity War." 
</p>
      <p>
  What this all means is "Endgame" is not just going to give the
  2019 box office a huge boost, but have an opening weekend that
  will blow past "Infinity War" (which has the record for best
  domestic opening with <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=marvel0518.htm">$257.6 million</a>) to have the biggest
  opening weekend of any movie ever.

  There was yet another Tesla fire, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-s-fire-explosion-shanghai-parking-garage-2019-4">
  this time in Shanghai</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  It broke out as a Tesla Model S was sitting in a parking garage.
  The car had not just suffered an impact, as in previous fire
  cases, and it was not charging. Thankfully, no one was hurt. The
  company is investigating the incident.

      <p>
  In the world of Tesla, fires have become a battleground for the

  of making too much of the sometimes <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-s-crash-that-killed-two-teens-being-investigated-by-ntsb-2018-5">
  grisly incidents</a>. They point out that combustible-engine
  fires happen all the time without garnering any attention.
</p>
      <p>
  Detractors accuse the company of not being open enough about the
  cause of the fires and why they sometimes occur even though a car
  has not appeared to have sustained any kind of impact.

  The debate has gotten so intense that CEO Elon Musk has joined
  the fray, tweeting in hopes of dispelling any notions that
  electric vehicles are more dangerous than cars with internal
  combustion engines.

  Chris Brown of Aristides Capital, who tweets under the moniker
  <a href="https://twitter.com/MidwestHedgie/status/1120856472102100992">@midwesthedgie</a>
  and is short Tesla, responded to Musk by walking through the
  numbers using data from the <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/ARCHIVED/Fire-statistics/Vehicle-fires/Highway-vehicle-fires">
  National Fire Protection Association</a> (where the most recent
  data available is from 2015).
</p>
      <p>
  Brown broke it down like this:
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>From 2011 to 2015, 325 people in the US on average died each
  year in internal-combustion-engine vehicle fires.
  </li>
  <li>That's out of 263.6 million registered vehicles in the
  US.
  </li>
  <li>
    That means there were, on average, about 1.23 fire deaths
    per million vehicles annually from 2011 to 2015. Most of them,
    <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/ARCHIVED/Fire-statistics/Vehicle-fires/Vehicle-fire-trends-and-patterns">
    58%, started with a vehicle collision or overturn</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tesla has yet to build 1 million total cars, but it has
    grown its fleet substantially in the past few years. In 2016 it
    had only 183,000 cars on the road. In February of last year it
    produced its <a href="https://electrek.co/2018/02/14/tesla-delivered-300000th-vehicle/">
    300,000th car</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the start of 2019, Tesla had about 530,000 cars on the
    road all over the world, the vast majority of those being in
    the US.
  </li>
  <li>"Thus, if Tesla were an average car, we would have
  expected 0.23 Tesla fire deaths in 2016, 0.35 in 2017, 0.45
  deaths in 2018, and 0.16 deaths in 1Q 2019," Brown wrote.
  <strong>That's a total of 1.19 fire deaths over three
  years.</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  Tragically, that isn't what has been happening.
</p>
      <p>
  Last month, a Davie, Florida man died after his Tesla crashed
  into a tree and ignited. First responders <a href="https://www.businessinsider.sg/florida-man-dies-after-his-tesla-model-s-crashed-caught-fire-2019-2/">
  were reportedly</a> not able to open the car's extendable door
  handles.
</p>
      <p>
  In December 2018, a <a href="https://t.co/DntMEMgHlR">woman in
  New Hampshire</a> died after her car crashed and ignited.
</p>
      <p>
  In <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article224101995.html">
  May 2018 two teenagers</a> in Fort Lauderdale, Florida died after
  Tesla Model S crashed into a wall and the battery caught fire.

</p>
      <p>
  Business Insider has counted at least 20 reported incidents of
  Teslas catching on fire since 2013 and five deaths in the last 14
  months.
</p>
      <p>
  That is some of why these fires are getting so much attention.
  It's life, death, and math.
</p>
      <p>
  Tesla called this calculation "misleading" because the occupants
  of these cars would have died when their cars crashed whether the
  cars caught on fire or not.
</p>
      <p>
  "The calculation cited by Business Insider is highly
  misleading because it implies that each of the cited fatalities
  were caused by fire-related injuries, whereas most traffic
  fatalities - even ones where a crash results in a fire - are due
  to impact-related injuries caused by the initial crash," said
  Tesla's spokesperson.
</p>
      <p>
  "Based on the evidence, in every such case we know of
  involving a Tesla vehicle, the occupant would have died whether
  the crash resulted in a fire or not. This analysis is also flawed
  in that it compares our powerful performance vehicles to the
  buses, motorcycles and trucks that are included in U.S. vehicle
  registration data."

</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>How it burns</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  The majority of these Tesla fires seem to be caused by the
  electric vehicle's battery suffering some kind of trauma,
  sometimes by crashing at high speeds. In the Davie, Florida
  incident the driver was going between 75 mph and 90 mph on a road
  with a 50 mph speed limit. The two teens who died in Fort
  Lauderdale were going 116 mph.
</p>
      <p>
  "Whether it's Tesla fires, or BMW or Fisker, if you look at
  the ones that caught on fire, almost every single one of them was
  operating outside of agency testing parameters," auto extrication
  and fire rescue expert <a href="https://advancedextrication.com/bio/">Brock Archer</a> told
  Business Insider over the phone. "They were going too fast and
  ended up crashing." 
</p>
      <p>
  But there have been a few fires, like the one in Shanghai, in
  which the battery was not damaged. These fires are strange even
  to those who have focused on preparing for an electric vehicle
  revolution.
</p>
      <p>
  "There are really only a few reasons why a lithium-ion
  battery catches on fire," Archer said. "Liquid, dead short, or
  spontaneous combustion [every] one in a billion [battery
  cells]."
</p>
      <p>
  Every Tesla battery is made up of thousands of cells, which
  are configured into the modules that make up a battery pack. So
  while one out of every billion cells sounds like a lot, consider
  that Tesla's Gigafactory aims to make 3 million cells a day, and
  <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-tesla-musk-panasonic-20190422-story.html">
  Elon Musk thinks that's not enough</a>. He wants more.
</p>
      <p>
  The arrival of lithium-ion batteries on the road is a
  unique challenge for rescue experts, who have ramped up efforts
  to teach first responders around the world the best practices for
  fighting lithium-ion battery fires. 
</p>
      <p>
  We should note here that Archer said that you are 8.2% less
  likely to be in an electric vehicle fire than an ICE fire -
  you're 10 times less likely in a hybrid since its high voltage
  battery is smaller - and that he thinks fighting an electric
  vehicle fire is no more difficult than fighting an ICE fire if
  you know what you're doing. 
</p>
      <p>
  We should also note that he's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X_WorH4pUw">worked closely with
  Tesla</a> on fire fighting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n5Wf7TlGrU">in the
  past.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  A damaged battery cell - whether the damage has been done
  by some kind of impact, water damage, or manufacturing defect -
  can go into "thermal runaway." That's when the
  temperature in the cell rapidly increases and then triggers the
  same reaction in another cell and another one after that. That is
  called "cellular propagation," and in some cases, it manages to
  stop itself inside the battery.
</p>
      <p>
  In other cases, though, you've got a fire on
  your hands.

  <strong>A different fire</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/8n5Wf7TlGrU">According to the training
  videos</a> being disseminated across the first responder world,
  firefighters cannot put out a lithium-ion battery fire with foam
  or dry chemicals. These fires cannot be fought with
  anything but 500 to 8,000 gallons of water and patience.
  Responders should expect a longer commitment time to the fight
  than they would in a combustible engine fire, and they should be
  mindful that the fire could reignite days after it seemed to have
  stopped.
</p>
      <p>
  That's what happened during another strange incident in Los
  Gatos, California last December.
</p>
      <p>
  The owner of a 2018 Tesla Model S with about 1200 miles on
  the odometer took <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/18/officials-investigate-mysterious-tesla-fire-los-gatos/">
  the car to a repair shop</a> after getting a flat tire on the
  highway. While the owner was inside the repair shop around 2 pm,
  the car suddenly ignited and firefighters were called. They used
  about 2,000 gallons of water to put the fire out.
</p>
      <aside>
  While the owner was inside the repair shop, the car suddenly
  ignited and firefighters were called. They used about 2,000
  gallons of water to put the fire out.
</aside>
      <p>
  The car reignited at the shop around 10 pm.
</p>
      <p>
  (This is why experts say that any electric vehicle that has
  experienced a battery fire should be kept 50 feet from any
  objects for a few days.)
</p>
      <p>
  A police report obtained by Business Insider could not determine
  the cause of the Los Gatos fire. Archer says that this is because
  oftentimes the source of the fire is so damaged that it's
  impossible to say what exactly caused the battery to go into
  thermal runaway - whether it was triggered by something outside
  the battery or a defect inside the battery.
</p>
      <p>
  To be fair, Tesla is not the only company that has dealt with
  stationary cars catching on fire. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/bmw-recalls-million-vehicles-fire-risk/story?id=50922136">
  In 2017 BMW recalled</a> a million cars with defective PCV
  valve heaters and blower motor system connectors after <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/bmw-mystery-fires-abc-news-investigation/story?id=47335778">
  ABC did an investigation</a> into mysterious fires starting in
  parked BMWs that would sometimes reignite days after being put
  out.
</p>
      <p>
  "At BMW, the safety of our customers is a top priority,"
  said BMW spokesman Hector Arellano-Belloc said in a statement
  after the recall was announced. "We understand the serious nature
  of a vehicle fire, which is why we are taking appropriate steps
  to repair our customers' vehicles."

      <h2>
  <strong>One in a billion</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  Archer stressed that there can be a lot of factors contributing
  to an electric vehicle fire from the outside, like any damage to
  the battery, but also the car's state of charge. Most incidents,
  he said, occur when a car is fully charged or charging.
</p>
      <p>
  And since a single defective cell can trigger thermal runaway,
  manufacturing glitches matter too.
</p>
      <p>
  That is why, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/panasonic-battery-cell-operations-tesla-gigafactory-chaotic-2019-4">
  as Business Insider previously reported</a>, an oil spill on the
  Panasonic operating side of Tesla's Gigafactory last September
  sent the factory scrambling. The spill was detected on
  September 17, according to internal documents viewed by Business
  Insider, but it's unclear exactly when it started. Mechanical oil
  got onto one of Panasonic's massive machines used to press
  battery chemicals into a sheet.
</p>
      <p>
  The machine then contaminated any of the product it
  touched. Employees had to stop what they were doing and sift
  through millions of nearly-finished battery cells to find
  potentially affected products, sources said. They searched for
  cells dating back to September 11t
</p>
      <p>
  Not all potentially-damaging incidents are that dramatic,
  though. Sources also reported incidents of tools or scissors
  falling into the massive 16 foot high mixers that churn lithium
  and other chemicals.
</p>
      <p>
  Greg Less, the technical director of the University of Michigan
  Energy Institute's Battery Fabrication and Characterization User
  Facility, told Business Insider that if a piece of shrapnel -
  something as small as a millimeter or half a millimeter - got
  into the lithium mix, the battery cell could potentially cause a
  hard short or even a fire.
</p>
      <p>
  "That's horrifying. If you have something metal inside of your
  mixer and its grinding around in your mixing jar you're going to
  get shrapnel," he said.
</p>
      <p>
  A Tesla spokesperson said that it conducts multiple tests
  on battery cells once they're received from Panasonic and that
  cells that don't make the cut are sent back to Panasonic.
</p>
      <p>
  "Tesla vehicles achieved the lowest probability of injury
  of any vehicles ever tested by U.S. government [NCAP] safety
  rating program," Tesla said in a statement to Business Insider,
  "and based on our fleet of over 500,000 electric cars, we know
  that a Tesla vehicle is approximately 10 times less likely to
  experience a fire than a gas car."

  <li>Trump, 72, currently holds the record as the oldest person to

  <li>
    "I look at Joe,
    I don't know about him. I don't know.
    I would never say anyone is too old.
    I know they are all making me look very
    young both in terms of age and I think in terms of
    energy," Trump said.

  The day after <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">former Vice President Joe
  Biden</a> formally entered the 2020 Democratic presidential
  primary field, President Donald Trump took a jab at Biden's age
  and jokingly called himself "a young, vibrant man."
</p>
      <p>
  Trump, 72, currently holds the record as the oldest person to
  take the office of the presidency at 70 years and 220 days old on
  Inauguration Day 2017.
</p>
      <p>
  But Biden, currently 76, and fellow Democratic contenders Sen.
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bernie-sanders-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Bernie Sanders</a>, 77, and Sen.
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-elizabeth-warren-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Elizabeth Warren</a>, 69, could
  break his record. 
</p>
      <p>
  If elected, Biden would be 78 years and 61 days old on
  Inauguration Day 2021. That would also break Ronald Reagan's
  record for the oldest president at any point in a presidency.
  Reagan was 77 years and 349 days old when he departed
  office.
</p>
      <p>
  "I
  think that I feel like a young man.
  I'm so young. I can't believe
  it. I'm the youngest person - I'm a young, vibrant
  man," Trump joked to reporters on the White House's South Lawn
  before departing on Air Force for an NRA convention in Indiana.
  
</p>
      <p>
  "I look at Joe, I don't know
  about him. I don't know. I would never
  say anyone is too old. I know they are
  all making me look very young both in terms of age and I
  think in terms of energy," Trump added.

  is acting like Joe Biden is his real competition for the
  presidency</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Trump views Biden, who served as President Barack
  Obama's Vice President for eight years and a US Senator for 36,
  as the biggest threat to his re-election chances and peppers his
  aides with questions about Biden's strength as a nominee,
  <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/25/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-1290338">according to a new report in
  Politico.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  Unlike other Democratic contenders, Biden centered
  his initial announcement not on any particular policy issues or
  why he was uniquely suited to lead, but on directly attacking
  Trump and the urgent need to defeat him. 
</p>
      <p>
  "Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe," <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1121388967444799488">Trump tweeted Thursday</a> after
  Biden formally entered the race. "I only hope you have the
  intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary
  campaign...but if you make it, I will see you at the Starting
  Gate!"

    <strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/lyft">Lyft</a>'s COO,
    a former Tesla executive, is the latest expert to throw cold
    water on Elon Musk's plan to have a million robo-taxis on the
    road by next year.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"I just don't know if that's possible to do," Jon
    McNeill told Business Insider in an interview.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>While Lyft is also researching autonomy, McNeill said
    the company is counting on having human drivers for plenty of
    years to come. </strong>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  Plenty of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-robo-taxi-prediction-a-publicity-stunt-an-expert-says-2019-4">
  people are skeptical</a> of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-takes-direct-aim-uber-lyft-with-robotaxi-plan-2019-4">
  Elon Musk's vision of one million self-driving Tesla
  robo-taxis</a> on the streets by next year, even one of his
  former executives.
</p>
      <p>
  Jon McNeill, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/lyft">Lyft'</a>s chief
  operating officer and former president of global sales and
  service, didn't go so far as to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-robo-taxis-elon-musk-pt-barnum-circus-2019-4">
  compare Musk to the great showman PT Barnum</a>, but he did
  express plenty of doubt for the billionaire's plan.
</p>
      <p>
  "I just don't know if that's possible to do," McNeill said in an
  interview with Business Insider. "What we spend our time thinking
  about is we've got a future that is driver-based."
</p>
      <p>
  Lyft, like Tesla and its major competitor Uber, is investing in
  self-driving cars too. The company's autonomous shuttles have
  facilitated more than 35,000 rides in Las Vegas as part of Lyft's
  partnership with Aptiv, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/lyft-ipo">it said in
  IPO filings earlier this year.</a> However, a wider roll out of
  that could be years away, and until then, the company is focused
  on its human drivers.
</p>
      <p>
  "What our research shows is that even with autonomy happening
  over the next few years - or starting to be deployed over the
  next few years - we'll need more drivers in five years than we
  have today," McNeill said. "And we'll need more drivers in 10
  years than we need in five years. So we're in the long-term
  driver business."
</p>
      <p>
  Lyft says it's barely scraped the surface of its potential
  market, which includes not just the hundreds of billions of car
  trips Americans take every year, but also on bikes, scooters and
  public transit. Shifting all of those to autonomous vehicles
  won't happen overnight, McNeill said.
</p>
      <p>
  "If you add up the overall revenues of Uber and Lyft, let's say
  we're $30-$35 billion dollars into that one trillion-dollar
  opportunity," he said. "So over the next five to ten years that
  $30-$35 billion, or 1% of miles traveled today, grows into that
  trillion-dollar opportunity. And it grows faster actually, we
  believe, than the penetration of autonomy."
</p>
      <p>
  "If autonomy is serving 5% of rides, you still need 95% of ride
  service by drivers," McNeill said.

    annual estimates of population change in America's
    counties</a>.
  </li>
  <li>The estimates included figures on natural population change,

  More people are dying than being born in nearly half of US
  counties.
</p>
      <p>
  The Census Bureau recently released its <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/estimates-county-metro.html">
  annual estimates of population change in each of the 3,142
  counties and county-equivalents in the US</a>. In addition to the
  total change in population in each county between July 1, 2017,
  and July 1, 2018, the Bureau also released estimates for the
  components of that population change.
</p>
      <p>
  The above map shows the net natural population change in each
  county, or the difference in the number of births and deaths in
  the county, adjusted by the total population of the county in
  2017. That represents the component of population change that
  isn't directly affected by people moving into and out of each
  county.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fastest-growing-and-shrinking-counties-in-america-2019-4">
  Here are the fastest growing and shrinking counties in
  America</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  In the map, counties with a natural population increase - more
  births than deaths - are in blue, while counties with a natural
  decrease - more deaths than births - are in red.
</p>
      <p>
  A little more than half of the counties - 1,757 of the 3,142
  total - had more births than deaths between 2017 and 2018. The
  map shows that large swaths of the interior West had robust
  natural population growth, while parts of the far Northeast,
  Appalachia, Florida, and the upper Midwest saw many more deaths
  than births.
</p>
      <p>
  Here are the 10 counties with populations of at least 10,000 with
  the biggest natural increases per 1,000 residents in 2017:

  And here are the 10 counties with the biggest natural decreases
  per 1,000 residents among counties with populations of at least
  10,000. Three of the top 10 counties are in Florida, and another
  three are in Virginia:

      <ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/trader-joes">Trader Joe's</a> line of Charles
    Shaw wines - also known as "Two-Buck Chuck" - are cheap.
  </li>
  <li>Business Insider's retail desk recently did a wine tasting
  with a number of these wines.
  </li>
  <li>We universally loathed the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/charles-shaw">Charles Shaw</a> white zinfandel.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">Visit
    Business Insider's homepage for more stories.</a>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  You can pick up a bottle of Trader Joe's Charles Shaw wine for
  just $3.99.
</p>
      <p>
  So I almost feel silly complaining about the quality of wine that
  costs less than a venti latte at Starbucks. The stuff goes by the
  nickname "Two-Buck Chuck," after all. It's not like Trader Joe's
  is hoodwinking us with this stuff.
</p>
      <p>
  Still, at Business Insider's workplace wine tasting, a few of the
  Charles Shaw bottles went down pretty easy. My four colleagues
  and I even enjoyed a few of the cheap red wines.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trader-joes-two-buck-chuck-wine-review-charles-shaw-2019-4">
  We taste-tested 8 of Trader Joe's 'Two-Buck Chuck' wines. Here's
  how they ranked from worst to best. </a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  But I'm afraid I can't say the same for the first wine we tasted
  that evening: the white zinfandel. In fact, when I took my first
  sip of that bright pink drink, I couldn't say much of anything at
  all. I mostly just winced.
</p>
      <p>
  I'm not a wine snob. From an oenological perspective, I'm pretty
  much a philistine and not a particularly picky one, at that. But
  the white zinfandel was something else - sickly sweet with a
  burning kick and a stubborn aftertaste. For me, it called to mind
  candy and regret.
</p>
      <p>
  "It tastes like a headache," one reviewer wrote. Another
  colleague likened the taste to that of a "melted Jolly Rancher."
</p>
      <p>
  We all gave the white zinfandel rock-bottom ratings. I'd say
  that, if you're in the market for a cheap bottle of Charles Shaw,
  the zin is the one to avoid.

  <li>"Avengers: Endgame" may be three hours, but it never feels
  long, as the action and fun plot keep the story moving.
  </li>
  <li>The movie also surprisingly has a lot of humor in it,
  following the dramatic ending of "Avengers: Infinity War."
  </li>
  <li>It may be hard to believe, but "Endgame" is a better movie
  than "Infinity War."

      <p>
  Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have pulled off a rare feat in
  today's franchise-heavy Hollywood. The brothers didn't just make
  a stellar movie to close a franchise (or "phase," as it pertains
  to the Marvel Cinematic Universe), but made a better movie than
  the penultimate entry.
</p>
      <p>
  "Avengers: Infinity War," also directed by the Russos, is great
  because it gives the movie that follows incredible stakes. I
  mean, the villain turns some of the biggest stars in the
  franchise into dust. <em>Can't wait to see the next movie!</em>
</p>
      <p>
  But in the past, that formula has often led to audience
  anticipation the creatives can't live up to. Look at "Return of
  the Jedi" after "Empire Strikes Back," "The Godfather Part III"
  after "Part II," or any "Terminator" movie after "Judgment Day."
  And even if the closing movie has good qualities, you often say
  to yourself, "Yeah, but the one before, <em>that</em> was great!"
</p>
      <p>
  And that's what's so amazing about "Avengers: Endgame" (in
  theaters Friday): It fulfills everything that was set up in
  "Infinity War."
</p>
      <p>
  One of the biggest surprises about "Endgame" is its tone. Coming
  off the seriousness of "Infinity War," you would think the movie
  would be a harsh revenge tale, as the existing Avengers try to
  avenge not only the friends they lost, but also half the
  population wiped out by Thanos. But in fact, there's a
  lightheartedness that flows through the movie and never feels out
  of place. That is a big help since "Endgame" is three hours long.
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cbf626e7456531e9d1d6343-1136-568.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <cite>Disney</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  And that fun factor comes from how the Avengers think
  they can win: through time travel.
</p>
      <p>
  I'm not going to give a lot away about the movie, but as you've
  probably seen Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) in the trailers, you know
  he's returned from the quantum realm - which is where we saw him
  last in "Ant-Man and the Wasp" - which means you know from that
  movie the time-travel angle is out there.
</p>
      <p>
  It's hard to not have fun with a time-travel plot. That includes
  figuring out how the time travel works as well as putting a spin
  on it that makes fun of classic time-travel movies. (Sorry, in
  the MCU time travel doesn't work like "Back to the Future.") Add
  a heist aspect - again, not going to get into details - and you
  have gold.
</p>
      <p>
  But that doesn't means there isn't drama. Getting back at Thanos
  has led some of the Avengers to take things pretty hard in their
  own ways. How it has affected Thor (Chris Hemsworth) leads to
  some of the funniest moments in the movie. But what Hawkeye
  (Jeremy Renner) has gone through is quite dark.

  "Avengers: Endgame" is poised to shatter the opening-weekend
  box-office record</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  What's hugely satisfying about "Endgame" is there is closure.
  Nothing is open ended. Outside of laying the groundwork for how
  some of the characters will move forward after phase one of the
  MCU, the movie answers all questions.
</p>
      <p>
  And you don't get cheated on the action either. The movie has one
  of the most fulfilling, all-out battle sequences that I've seen
  in a long time.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>Now, a few tips as you prepare to go see the
  movie:</strong>
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>If you can, go back and watch the "Captain America"-focused
  movies and "Infinity War."
  </li>
  <li>Pack some extra tissues.
  </li>
  <li>And (this may be the most important) go to the bathroom
  before the movie starts.
  </li>
</ul>

  Venture capitalists want to be convinced.
</p>
      <p>
  Ask <a href="http://www.davidsrose.com/#intro">David Rose,</a>
  and he'll tell you VCs wouldn't be hearing your pitch in the
  first place if they weren't interested in investing. Rose runs
  Gust, a digital platform for early-stage entrepreneurs and
  investors, and Rose Tech Ventures, an angel investment fund and
  incubator.
</p>

  He said investors are just hoping you'll give them a compelling
  argument for why they should partner with you.
</p>
      <p>
  We asked Rose, plus a series of other successful investors
  (listed below), what persuades them to sign on - and what leaves
  them skeptical. Below, we've compiled their best advice, on

  Estes <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-biotech-vcs-biggest-mistake-startup-founders-make-pitch-2018-9">
  previously told Business Insider's Lydia Ramsey</a> that biotech
  investors want to know how a new tool will fit into the current
  standard of care. "The biggest mistake I see is when someone
  spends more time talking about how a product would affect the
  market than they do talking about how it would affect the disease
  it's designed to treat," Estes said.
</p>
      <p>
  The same is true for any investor, who wants to know how your
  business will make people's lives easier.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>Don't be cocky</strong>
</p>
      <p>
  In an interview with Business Insider's Becky Peterson, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gv-investor-dave-munichiello-what-looks-for-startup-pitches-2018-7">
  Munichiello pointed</a> to Stewart Butterfield, founder and CEO
  of Slack, as an example of an entrepreneur who didn't pretend he
  had all the answers. (GV invested in Slack in 2014 as part of a
  $120 million round that valued the company at $1.12 billion,
  Peterson reported.)
</p>
      <p>
  "Stewart's conversation with me wasn't about all of the reasons
  why Slack was awesome," Munichiello said. "It was, 'Here's how I
  think about the business. And you may think about it in a
  different way.' And 'Here are the metrics that I use to measure
  the business. How do you think about the business?'"
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>Hold your ground on the issues that matter most</strong>
</p>
      <p>
  "Entrepreneurs can, and should, articulate deal breakers to their
  prospective investors," <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-pitch-a-venture-capitalist-2017-4">
  Selverian wrote on Business Insider</a>. "If there's something
  that's important to you and your business, don't compromise. As
  long as the entrepreneur's reasoning is justified, many investors
  will be impressed by the vision and leadership conveyed through
  deal breakers."

  <strong>Show that you can sell your idea</strong>
</p>
      <p>
  "One of the critical tests that I try to run when I'm sitting
  across from a founder is: Can you sell me your idea?" <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ashton-kutcher-invest-startup-2018-9">
  Kutcher said</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2018. If not, he
  worries about the company's future.
</p>
      <p>
  "If you can't sell me, how are you going to sell your first hire,
  your second hire, your third hire?" Kutcher said.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>Demonstrate your path to execution</strong>
</p>
      <p>
  At Business Insider's Startup 2012 conference, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/10-vcs-and-founders-share-their-tips-on-how-startups-should-be-fundraising-2012-5#investor-laura-sachar-says-she-can-spot-entrepreneurs-who-have-ideas-but-dont-know-how-to-execute-them-5">
  Sachar said</a> she needs to believe the entrepreneur can turn
  their idea into a successful business.
</p>
      <p>
  "If you can't execute, you don't have a company," she said. "A
  lot of people have ideas."

  The glitz of 'entrepreneurship porn' leads startup founders to
  make fatal business mistakes. Here's how to avoid them</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>Tell investors how you plan to expand</strong>
</p>
      <p>
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/entrepreneurship-guide-create-pitch-deck-startup-2019-4">
  Duggal previously told Business Insider</a> every pitch deck
  should include a five-year growth plan.
</p>
      <p>
  Duggal added that she wants to see the costs of building your
  product or service, the potential profit "on a unit basis," and
  how that changes at scale. In other words, she said, "As your
  business grows, do the margins get better?"
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>Prepare a detailed appendix in addition to the
  deck</strong>
</p>
      <p>
  Your deck should be simple and straightforward. During the pitch
  meeting, Selverian recommends having a detailed appendix that
  will answer any questions that come up.
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/576d93c552bcd0210c8cbb7e-1920-1440.jpg"/>

          <cite>Getty/Noam Galai</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  <strong>Address the potential competition</strong>
</p>
      <p>
  One common mistake Duggal sees in pitch decks is "not addressing
  competition or figuring out the market landscape."
</p>
      <p>
  She added, "When we think about investing in a company, we want
  to understand - that's great that you have an interesting idea or
  you spotted something that has the potential to be an exciting
  business - but we also want to understand what is already in the
  market."
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>Propose an action plan in a thank-you note</strong>
</p>
      <p>
  In your follow-up note after the pitch meeting, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/entrepreneurship-guide-pitch-deck-startup-venture-capitalist-raise-money-2019-3">
  McGinnis said</a>, "propose concrete next steps for them to react
  to - amorphous communication conveys amorphous management."
  Reiterate specifically what you're asking for, and ask whether
  there are other people you should meet who the investors can
  introduce you to.
</p>
      <p>
  You can also create FOMO by letting them know when another VC has
  already agreed to invest.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>Determine whether you need to raise capital in the first
  place</strong>
</p>
      <p>
  If you're bringing in a maximum of $1 million a year in revenue,
  "it may be a great, wonderful, much-needed business," <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/entrepreneurship-guide-pitch-deck-startup-venture-capitalist-raise-money-2019-3">
  Rose said</a>. "You may enjoy it and support your family." But he
  emphasized, "the economics are just such that there is no way
  that you can get an investment from me at any reasonable number
  for that to make economic sense."
</p>
      <p>
  This is because outside investors expect outsize returns on their
  money, often a large multiple of what they put in. And if there's
  a low-millions ceiling on the revenue your startup can generate
  or eventual exit price, there's not much incentive for a venture
  capitalist to write you a check.
</p>
      <p>
  In other words, your company may be a "lifestyle startup," which
  doesn't require venture capital and probably won't ever be worth
  $1 billion.

    <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/">SmileDirectClub</a> is an at-home
    teeth-straightening service. 
  </li>
  <li>
    On Thursday, CVS said it would add SmileDirectClub
    locations to hundreds of its stores. Shoppers will be able to
    get a 3D image of their mouth made by a SmileDirect employee at
    CVS locations. This image is then sent to a dentist or
    orthodontist to approve their treatment plan. 
  </li>
  <li>
    SmileDirectClub has been criticized by orthodontists who
    say that in-person visits are important in this type of care.
    
  </li>
  <li>
    CVS has been pushing to add more in-store services in
    recent years to compete with Amazon.

  CVS Health is venturing into dental care with plans to offer a
  relatively new teeth-straightening service.
</p>
      <p>
  The drugstore chain said Thursday that it will add
  SmileDirectClub locations to hundreds of its stores, where
  customers can get started on getting their teeth straightened
  without an in-person visit with a dentist or orthodontist. That
  lack of an office visit has drawn criticism from orthodontists.

  A buzzy $3.2 billion startup that helps you get braces without
  seeing a dentist is planning to go public</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  CVS Health and other drugstores have been pushing in recent years
  to add more services to their store locations, in part to help
  their customers stay healthy. They're also trying to attract
  customers for profitable beauty products and stave off
  competition like the online retail giant Amazon.com, which
  provides same-day delivery for many of the products that
  drugstores sell outside their pharmacies.
</p>
      <p>
  Under the CVS plan, customers get a 3D image of their mouth made
  by a SmileDirect employee at one of the drugstore locations. The
  image is sent to a dentist or orthodontist who approves the
  patient's treatment plan. Patients are shipped clear, removable
  aligners designed to straighten their teeth.
</p>
      <p>
  They check in remotely with a dentist or orthodontist, often by
  smartphone. The service costs $1,850 before insurance.
</p>
      <p>
  The American Association of Orthodontists has criticized the
  service, warning that in-person visits are important in this type
  of care. Dentists can spot gum disease during these visits and
  X-rays can detect bone loss not seen in a photo, the group's
  lawyer Sean Murphy said.
</p>
      <p>
  "Our concern is patient health and safety," Murphy said.
</p>
      <p>
  CVS Pharmacy President Kevin Hourican said he has no concerns
  about safety with SmileDirect, which he said provides a "high
  quality" product and limits care to patients who don't have
  complex dental needs.
</p>
      <p>
  SmileDirect spokeswoman Carrie Moore said the company, which
  started in 2014, has served more than half a million people. She
  said in an email that it is common for "traditional industry
  representatives to balk" when a new business model gains
  acceptance.
</p>
      <p>
  CVS Health also will add SmileDirect service as a covered option
  in the dental care network of its recently acquired Aetna health
  insurance business. Another insurer, UnitedHealthcare, announced
  a similar coverage expansion Thursday.
</p>
      <p>
  The SmileDirect locations will appear in only a small percentage
  of CVS Health's 9,800 retail locations nationally. But company
  officials say they may eventually expand to more than a thousand
  locations. The company started testing the approach in a few
  stores last fall.
</p>
      <p>
  CVS Health found in its pilot that the SmileDirect locations
  attracted younger, new customers.
</p>
      <p>
  "People want to improve their smile, and they feel better about
  themselves," Hourican said.

  Starbucks' shares hit an all-time high after reporting quarterly
  earnings on Thursday. However, the coffee giant still has one
  problem it needs to solve. 
</p>
      <p>
  While US comparable sales grew 4% in the quarter, the increase
  was driven entirely by an increase in average ticket size, with
  transactions remaining flat. Beverage sales contributed 3% of the
  total 4% growth in American same-store sales.

  Starbucks jumps to record high after beating on earnings and
  raising guidance </a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Starbucks has struggled to grow transactions in the US in recent
  years. Transactions were flat in the US in the last quarter after
  two quarters of decline.
</p>
      <p>
  Analysts have been pushing for Starbucks to address its inability
  to draw more people into coffee shops across the US.  
</p>
      <p>
  "The comp progression of recent quarters has been reassuring that
  the right balance of initiatives (menu, digital) are in- place to
  achieve mid-single-digit comps, though we remain concerned about
  the minimal contribution from traffic," BTIG analyst Peter Saleh
  wrote in a note on Friday, noting that the chain's traffic
  remained "anemic." 
</p>
      <p>
  Wells Fargo's Bonnie Herzog said in a note on Friday that she
  believed improvements to the in-store experience, new drinks, and
  a delivery deal with Uber Eats were helping fix what she had
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-fix-flat-store-traffic-2019-1">
  previously called Starbucks' "traffic problem" in the US. </a>

</p>
      <p>
  In 2018, Starbucks discussed how workers' tasks are being
  tweaked - some work is being shifted to after hours and other
  tasks are being automated - in order to encourage more
  interaction with customers. On Thursday, Starbucks said that the
  company had achieved its highest level of customer-connection
  scores in the US since it began measuring that in 2015. 
</p>
      <p>
  In March, Starbucks announced it is reimagining its "third place"
  concept, utilizing new store designs to better meet customers'
  needs. And the chain has added needle-disposal boxes and other
  solutions to help employees address complaints over messes and
  drug paraphernalia left in stores.

  Starbucks is installing needle-disposal boxes in locations across
  America following OSHA penalties and worker concerns about drug
  use in bathrooms</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  So far, these changes have failed to substantially boost traffic.
  
</p>
      <p>
  "Starbucks does not seem to be attracting all that many new
  audiences," Neil Saunders, the managing director of
  GlobalData Retail, said in a comment in January. 
</p>
      <p>"Indeed, it still underperforms with younger coffee drinkers who are increasingly going to niche independent coffee shops because of the more authentic vibe and modern atmosphere," Saunders added. "In our view, this weakness will become more obvious as conditions become tougher and it is not something we believe Starbucks has plans to remedy."</p>

    <strong><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/category/playstation-5">Sony's
    next PlayStation</a> console is deep in development, but it
    still has a long way to go until it's available to
    buy.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The next PlayStation console, widely expected to be
    named PlayStation 5, won't arrive until May 2020 at the
    earliest.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>That's according to Sony, <a href="https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1121687268123529216">which
    told reporters</a> that it won't release its next-gen game
    console any time in the next 12 months.</strong>

  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/playstation-5-release-date-price-specs-features-2019-4">
  Sony's next PlayStation</a> is deep in production, but that
  doesn't mean it's on the verge of launching.
</p>
      <p>
  Quite the opposite in fact: Sony says that it's next PlayStation
  game console won't arrive until at least May 2020.
</p>
      <p>
  The news comes out of Sony's annual financial release, which
  outlined the Japanese electronics giant's coming year - and,
  notably, doesn't include the launch of the next PlayStation
  console.
</p>
      <figure>

          <h1>"Cyberpunk 2077" is another game many people expect to arrive on next-generation video game consoles.</h1>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  The console hasn't been officially named, but it is widely
  believed to be be named "PlayStation 5" given historic precedent
  - PlayStations 1 through 4 say hello.
</p>
      <p>
  Sony did reveal <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/playstation-5-release-date-price-specs-features-2019-4">
  a variety of details</a> about the console <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/playstation-5-details-2019-4">in
  a recent interview with Wired</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  Among the details:
</p>
      <ol>
  <li>The next PlayStation has a new central processing unit and a
  graphics processing unit from AMD. The former is based on AMD's
  Ryzen line, while the latter is part of Radeon's Navi GPU line.
  </li>
  <li>It contains a solid state drive instead of a hard disc drive,
  intended to dramatically decrease loading times for games.
  </li>
  <li>It supports PlayStation 4 games as well as PlayStation 5, and
  is also compatible with PlayStation VR headsets.
  </li>
  <li>It's capable of powering 8K visuals and producing "Ray
  Tracing" effects - the long way of saying, "games will look
  better than ever."
  </li>
</ol>
      <p>
  And now, one more detail we know: It won't arrive until at least
  May 2020. Applying past precedent here as well, it's likely Sony
  won't launch the PlayStation 5 until holiday 2020 - but that
  remains to be seen.

  is for sale - but functionally, it's identical to the Echo First
  Generation. The main difference is its appearance, which is
  fabric-covered rather than the industrial plastic finish of the
  original.

      <h2>
  <strong>What can you do with the Amazon Echo?</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  Let's start by looking at what
  you can do with all of the Echo models, and then talk about some
  differences later.
</p>
      <p>
  First and foremost, Alexa
  responds to your voice - you wake whatever model of Echo you have
  by saying "Alexa…" followed by a question. You can also configure
  it to respond to "Echo" instead. There are virtually countless
  questions you can ask the Echo. In some cases, the device will
  respond verbally with the answer. At other times, it will send a
  link to more information on the internet to your Echo mobile
  app.
</p>
      <p>
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XCM9LJ4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bi_042519_what-can-amazon-echo-do-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B06XCM9LJ4&amp;linkId=f38bc8ee06f9b4d1245103cd0cd40dd9">The Echo</a> is also optimized to
  respond to a large number of specific questions or commands. As a
  very small sampling of the device's capabilities, here are some
  commands it recognizes:
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>
    Alexa, tell me the news.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alexa, wake me at 7AM
    tomorrow.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alexa, set a 30-minute
    timer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alexa, what's on my calendar
    today?
  </li>
  <li>
    Alexa, play the Beatles.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alexa, what's the
    weather?
  </li>
  <li>
    Alexa, tell me a joke.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  When combined with additional
  smart home devices and software, an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XCM9LJ4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bi_042519_what-can-amazon-echo-do-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B06XCM9LJ4&amp;linkId=f38bc8ee06f9b4d1245103cd0cd40dd9">Echo</a> can also control other
  devices. You can say "Alexa, turn on the kitchen light" to turn
  smart lights on by voice. You can lock and unlock certain brand
  front-door smart locks, and trigger and disable smart home alarm
  systems. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XCM9LJ4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bi_042519_what-can-amazon-echo-do-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B06XCM9LJ4&amp;linkId=f38bc8ee06f9b4d1245103cd0cd40dd9">The Echo</a> can also control
  Sonos and other multi-room audio systems.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>Special features of Amazon Echo products</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  As Amazon has expanded the Echo
  product line, it has made sure that all its devices can perform
  the same core commands, but various models have certain
  additional capabilities.
</p>
      <p>
  The Amazon Echo Plus has all of
  the features (and appearance) as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XCM9LJ4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bi_042519_what-can-amazon-echo-do-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B06XCM9LJ4&amp;linkId=f38bc8ee06f9b4d1245103cd0cd40dd9">original Echo</a>, but it includes
  a Zigbee smart home hub. This means that if you want to add smart
  devices in your home like SmartThings or Philips Hue lights, you
  don't need a standalone hub - it's built into the Plus.
</p>
      <p>
  The Amazon Echo Show is what you
  get if you combine an Echo speaker with a tablet. Equipped with a
  10-inch display (or 7 inches for the older first generation), the
  Show has a built-in voice-activated web browser, can show photos,
  video, music lyrics, and more. Perhaps its most interesting
  feature is that it includes a video chat app that is like
  FaceTime, except you don't need to hold it up in the air.

  The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073SQYXTW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bi_042519_what-can-amazon-echo-do-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B073SQYXTW&amp;linkId=251b3c76cbd5240b47cb51c5d754012c">Amazon Echo Spot</a> is smaller
  than the Echo - somewhat larger than the puck-like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-amazon-echo-dot">Echo Dot</a> - but it adds a circular,
  2.5-inch display. Unlike most Echo speakers, which can only
  communicate with you verbally or send information to your mobile
  app, the Spot can display information for you to read or watch.
  Functionally, though, it's otherwise the same as the Echo.

  <li>
    <a href="https://amzn.to/2RZx2n0">Takeya's Actives Insulated Stainless Water Bottle
    ($18-$32)</a> is cheap, but it works really well.
  </li>
  <li>It's easy to drink out of, as much as <a href="https://amzn.to/2MnSnkD">$22
  cheaper than Hydro Flask</a>, and consistently maintains
  temperature. I use the Takeya water bottle in the office, gym,
  and at home.
  </li>
  <li>When I filled it with ice and cold brew at 9 a.m. on a
  Tuesday, there were still ice cubes in it when I checked back at
  9 a.m. on Wednesday. 
  </li>
  <li>It also has a lifetime warranty, and a clip that can attach
  to a gym bag by a carabiner.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  If you're looking to cut out plastic water bottles - or just
  seeking ideal, preternatural temperature control - you're
  probably going to wind up shopping the hallowed aisles of
  stainless steel, double wall vacuum-insulated bottles. And, while
  you're there, you should check out the cheap but efficient
  <a href="https://amzn.to/2RZx2n0">Takeya Actives Water Bottle ($18-$32)</a>, especially
  if you lead an active lifestyle. Over the last couple of months,
  it has become my go-to companion for everything from the office
  to home to nightly workouts. 
</p>
      <p>
  Takeya makes my default recommendation for an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/takeya-cold-brew-iced-coffee-maker-review">inexpensive, convenient, and
  effective at-home cold brew maker</a>, so I was willing to bet
  their take on the stainless steel water bottle would be good too.
  And it is - it's easy to drink out of, big enough not to require
  too frequent of refills, and a standout at keeping beverages at
  their ideal temperature.
</p>
      <p>
  When I filled it with ice and cold brew at 9 a.m. on a Tuesday,
  there were still ice cubes floating in it when I checked back at
  9 a.m. on Wednesday. By comparison, another popular option for
  temperature control is <a href="https://amzn.to/2MnSnkD">Hydro Flask's 32 oz stainless steel
  sports water bottle</a>. The Hydro Flask claims to keep hot
  drinks hot up to six hours, and cold drinks cold up to 24 hours.
  Takeya claims to keep hot drinks hot for up to 12 hours, and cold
  drinks cold for up to 24 hours. Though Insider Picks reporter
  Brandt Ranj found <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hyrdro-flask-bottle-review-2017-3">Hydro Flask's numbers to be
  conservative</a>, Takeya stacks up. Takeya is also up to $22
  cheaper; the Hydro Flask usually retails for $40 on its site and
  $45 on Amazon, though a straw lid is included in Amazon's price
  and sold separately (<a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=73c3833f-ca52-45ea-b3b4-bf051ca7bb1a&amp;website_id=9597bdee-ce2a-4552-aa13-419b5f275c06&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hydroflask.com%2Fstraw-lid%2Fcolor%2Cflamingo%2Ca%2C92%2Co%2C68">$10</a>) on Hydro Flask. For some
  athletes, the wide straw lid also isn't as convenient while
  working out as Takeya's twist-off. You can purchase an <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=73c3833f-ca52-45ea-b3b4-bf051ca7bb1a&amp;website_id=9597bdee-ce2a-4552-aa13-419b5f275c06&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hydroflask.com%2Fstandard-mouth-insulated-sport-cap%2Fcolor%2Cblack%2Ca%2C92%2Co%2C20">insulated sport cap on Hydro
  Flask</a>, too, but it's $10 more and not compatible with hot
  liquids. 
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c474b522bdd7f3d4c33217a-1536-1152.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <cite>Takeya Facebook</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  In fact, Takeya's lid deserves its own little shoutout.
</p>
      <p>
  It's insulated, outfitted with leak-proof technology that hasn't
  failed me yet, and the spout is convenient enough for the
  one-handed pouring of tea into a cup or water into your mouth
  during a fast-paced workout. The stainless-steel pin also locks
  the hinge when it's flipped open, so you can drink without
  getting smacked by the cap when you tilt the bottle upwards.
  Additionally, the design has a loop
  for easy clipping onto your bags.
</p>
      <p>
  Another smart feature Takeya's bottle has in common with more
  expensive options is a wide-mouth design that's easier to
  accommodate ice and cleaning than a narrow opening.
</p>
      <p>
  It's also designed for durability with a powder finish and
  removable silicone bumper, so you can knock it around without
  worrying. And what's more, it has a lifetime warranty.
</p>
      <p>
  All in all, the Takeya Actives Water Bottle has been a great
  value for $25. If you're looking for cheap, convenient, and
  effective temperature control in versatile sizes and colors, it's
  definitely worth checking out - especially if you're using it in
  workouts, or if you like the sound of an always ice-cold drink
  for up to 24 hours.

      <ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/new-orleans">New
    Orleans</a> has some of the most iconic <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/bars">bars</a> in
    America.
  </li>
  <li>
    On a recent trip to New
    Orleans, I visited several of the city's landmark upscale bars,
    as well as some of the local dives that locals swear by.
  </li>
  <li>
    I noticed a huge difference in
    the experience you get at both types of bar - and I know which
    kind I'll be returning to next time I'm in the Big Easy.
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/new-orleans">New
  Orleans</a> is a place of endless contradictions.
</p>
      <p>
  The city's multifaceted culture
  is an enormous draw for tourists. And in particular, the
  epicurious ones.
</p>
      <p>
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bartender-most-annoying-things-bar-2019-4">
  As a bartender</a> about to embark on my first "true" taste of
  New Orleans (a college spring break trip during Mardi Gras where
  my friends and I slept in the car and ate only at Waffle House
  doesn't count) - I was determined to experience each side of the
  city's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/bars">bar
  culture</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  The fancy, and the divey.
</p>
      <p>
  Like most bartenders, I gravitate
  to the dives. But New Orleans is exceptional: This is a city
  whose upscale bars either birthed or perfected several of the
  classic cocktails I make on a daily basis.
</p>
      <p>
  Armed with local friends to guide
  me to the humbler taverns, and expert bartender recommendations
  on the fancier joints, I got a fantastic taste of both the posh
  and proletarian watering holes.
</p>
      <p>
  As much as I enjoy elegant hand
  soaps and bartenders in bow ties, I fully plan to skip the haute
  hangouts on the next visit.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>At most of the upscale bars I visited, you pay more for
  the same quality - or sometimes worse</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  I'll start with the Big One.
  Sticker shock. Obviously, that's a perfectly normal caveat if
  you're going to be bougie in the Big Easy.
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc21688b14bf46f121237c8-1136-1515.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <h1>Cocktails at the landmark Sazerac Bar in New Orleans.</h1>
          <cite>Emma Witman</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  But the real kicker is that you aren't paying more for more when
  you drink at a fancy bar. You're paying more for the same.
</p>
      <p>
  Hotels house most of New Orleans'
  fanciest bars. These are the bars that bring with them infamy,
  legacy, and of-a-different-time atmospheres, drawing in droves of
  tourists.
</p>
      <p>
  While the splendor is lovely to
  look at, I found that the "luxury tax," so to speak, is brazenly
  audacious in New Orleans. Worse even than that pesky <a href="https://www.salestaxhandbook.com/louisiana/rates/new-orleans">9.45%
  sales tax</a> you're also slapped with in the city.
</p>
      <p>
  The "house" or "well" liquors
  might - but not necessarily - be a small upgrade. Tanqueray
  versus Gordon's. Maker's Mark versus Old Grand-Dad. But at most,
  it's the sort of difference that should account for $1 or $2
  more.
</p>
      <p>
  Instead, basics like a gin and
  tonic creep into the double digits. With "the cheap
  stuff."
</p>
      <p>
  At the very least, I felt that a
  double-digit Bacardi daiquiri should also buy five minutes
  sitting at the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/whimsical-carousel-bar-in-new-orleans-2016-10">
  Carousel Bar &amp; Lounge's
  eponymous rotating attraction</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  Instead, I stood spitefully
  sipping my $13 drink as I watched the lucky passengers' slow
  orbit around the bar. I finally gave up after a solid 20 minutes
  of trying to scout an open seat before exiting through the
  glamourous lobby of the Hotel Monteleone.
</p>
      <p>
  What the humbler haunts of New
  Orleans lack in indoor amusement park rides, they make up with
  something you'll never see at the fancy bars whose reputations
  precede them: specials.
</p>
      <p>
  One review of a favorite dive bar
  of my trip, Bar Tonique, said it best: "When you need a break
  from Bourbon Street, but can't leave the Quarter, <a href="https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-orleans/reviews/bar-tonique">
  head to Bar Tonique for a quality $5
  cocktail</a>, and no
  bachelor parties."
</p>
      <p>
  I thought I was dreaming when I
  saw their Caipirinha listed at $5. Because other than cheap beer,
  you're be hard-pressed to find anything for $5 behind the hotel
  bars.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>There was a major difference in the makeup of the bar
  staff, too</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  There was another thing you rarely see behind the hotel bars that
  I saw at every single dive bar I visited - women.
</p>
      <p>
  By my count, in four hotel and
  upscale bars with approximately 12 bartenders total, I counted
  among them one woman. One.
</p>
      <p>
  I was flummoxed by the imbalance,
  perhaps naively: In all fairness to New Orleans the lopsided
  ratio is likely a more damning indictment of <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/if-more-than-half-of-american-bartenders-are-women-why-is-the-craft-cocktail-industry-dominated-by">
  craft cocktail culture in
  general</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  And if you're looking, you can
  find plenty of badass females bartending in the city.
</p>
      <p>
  But still, I hated to see the
  lack of women at the storied, iconic hotel bars. Representation
  matters.
</p>
      <p>
  It was at the Sazerac Bar, inside
  the Roosevelt New Orleans (a Waldorf Astoria hotel) that I
  encountered the lone XX mixologist of my hotel bar crawl. Rachel,
  by the way, made my favorite Vesper of the entire trip.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>Don't be suprised if the cocktails you get at the dive
  bars are better than their upscale counterparts</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  But don't be surprised if the cocktail you get at a dive is just
  as good - if not better - than a fancy bar's creation.
</p>
      <p>
  In fact, my second favorite
  Vesper of the trip came from Red Truck Clubhouse, a dimly lit
  dive favored by off-duty bartenders.
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc216fb16c65a5ad3699eaf-1136-1516.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <h1>A bartender at the Red Truck Clubhouse dive bar.</h1>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  Seem impossible? Far from it. In
  fact, craft cocktail bartending has become so prolific, you can
  find it almost anywhere. I'd venture to guess that even
  establishments lowest on the pecking order of cocktailing make
  Old Fashioneds.
</p>
      <p>
  The Red Truck was a breath of
  fresh air, and I was
  fortunate to discover this gem of a place via a friend and former
  coworker who bartends at
  the Ritz-Carlton's Davenport Lounge.
</p>
      <p>
  In the course of a day at hotel
  bars, people-wise I had pretty much only seen a) other tourists,
  and b) tightly uniformed staff. The experience felt like a
  Disney-fied version of the city.
</p>
      <p>
  At Red Truck, I talked to locals,
  took the bartender's favorite shot (equal parts tequila and
  Cynar), and devoured $2 pizza by the slice.
</p>
      <p>
  No, it wasn't my favorite meal.
  But you know what <em>also</em> wasn't my favorite meal? A $68 brunch
  consisting of a bland omelette, a few mimosas, and a strawberry
  crepe that admittedly was so good it almost justified the price.
  Almost.
</p>
      <p>
  Nope. Favorite meal, in fact, was
  some of the <a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/entertainment_life/food_restaurants/article_9975230a-091c-11e8-b074-af4eed6f3855.html">
  best fried chicken of my life
  from a gas station</a> that cost less than $10.
</p>
      <p>
  From <a href="https://www.thisisinsider.com/abandoned-six-flags-new-orleans-2018-1">
  theme parks abandoned after Hurricane Katrina</a>, to the hotel
  bars featuring full-sized rides within them, New Orleans'
  paradoxical nature is what makes the city simultaneously so
  baffling, endearing, and enigmatic.
</p>
      <p>
  In this sense,
  a true sampling of the NOLA bar
  scene might require hitting the hotels, and if I had to choose a
  couple fancy bars to revisit, I'd go with these: Arnaud's French
  75 Bar, for the atmosphere and cocktail napkins alone; and the
  Davenport Lounge, for the air conditioning and complimentary
  homemade potato chips and wasabi peas.
</p>
      <p>
  But if you're pondering where to
  focus the majority of your spirituous endeavors in New Orleans,
  my response mirrors my answer to the age old question of "What's
  your favorite drink on the menu?" when a guest can't decide what
  to order.
</p>
      <p>
  It's a matter of personal
  preference.
</p>
      <p>
  Personally, I'll forgo the fancy
  bars next time. Even if I never get to ride that dang
  carousel.

    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/slack">Slack</a>, the
    buzzy workplace-chat platform last valued at over $7 billion,
    filed the paperwork on Friday to publicly list its shares.

  <li>The company has tapped into an interesting new trend for tech

  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/slack">Slack</a>, the
  workplace-chat platform that's taken offices by storm, filed the
  paperwork on Friday to go public, kicking off the final countdown
  to its listing and shedding light on the financial happenings at
  one of Silicon Valley's most valuable startups.
</p>
      <p>
  Slack was last valued at about $17 billion on secondary-market
  trades, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/25/slack-valued-at-17-billion-on-secondary-market-ahead-of-public-debut.html">
  CNBC reported</a>. It was officially valued at $7.1 billion after
  its latest financing round, last August.
</p>
      <p>
  <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm#s017FDB05ADCA47A884DF567D8F380B27">
  In its S-1 filing</a>, Slack said it planned to list on the New
  York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SK through a direct
  listing, a unique alternative to the initial public offering in
  which private shareholders such as investors and employees sell
  their holdings directly to the public.
</p>
      <p>
  The company said $100 million worth of shares would be sold,
  though that's most likely a placeholder number.
</p>
      <p>
  Unlike in a standard IPO, Slack won't raise a bunch of new cash
  from investors rushing to buy its stock, and it won't set a share
  price.
</p>
      <p>
  It would be the second big tech company to go public in this way
  recently, after <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-stock-price-ipo-ticker-time-what-to-expect-as-the-streaming-music-giant-goes-public-2018-4?r=US&amp;IR=T">
  Spotify did a direct listing</a> last April.
</p>
      <h2>
  Slack is trimming its losses but says it may never be profitable
</h2>
      <p>
  The firm also lifted the lid on its financial performance over
  the past three years.
</p>
      <p>
  During the year ended January 31, 2017, Slack lost $146 million
  on $105.2 million in revenue.
</p>
      <p>
  The following year it lost $140 million on $220.5 million in
  revenue.
</p>
      <p>
  And in the year ending January 31, 2019, it lost $138.9 million
  on $400.6 million in revenue.
</p>
      <p>
  The company, which makes money predominantly from monthly or
  yearly subscriptions, said it counts 88,000 paying customers, 575
  of which account for more than $100,000 in recurring yearly
  revenue and make up 40% of Slack's total business. The startup
  said it has more than 500,000 organizations on its free tier.
</p>
      <p>
  The firm wrote: "We expect to continue to incur net losses for
  the foreseeable future and we may not achieve or maintain
  profitability in the future.
</p>
      <p>
  "Because the market for Slack, and the features, integrations,
  and capabilities we offer on Slack, is rapidly evolving and has
  not yet reached widespread adoption, it is difficult for us to
  predict our future results of operations or the limits of our
  market opportunity."
</p>
      <p>
  The company said it expected a significant increase in operating
  expenses thanks to hiring and development.
</p>
      <p>
  Slack said it has more than 10 million daily active users
  globally, with more than half outside the US.
</p>
      <p>
  Slack has always billed itself as an email killer and, listing
  the risks to its business, said that email was a competitor.
</p>
      <p>
  The firm also listed Microsoft as its primary competitor and
  described Google, Facebook, and Cisco as business-software
  rivals. It also said existing partners such as Atlassian, Okta,
  Oracle, ServiceNow, SAP, Workday, Zoom, and Salesforce were
  potential direct or indirect rivals.
</p>
      <h2>
  It's a banner year for tech IPOs
</h2>
      <p>
  Slack will be the latest in the parade of unicorn tech companies
  - named as such for their $1 billion-plus valuations - to go
  public this year.
</p>
      <p>
  Uber filed an amended S-1 early Friday with <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uber-is-going-public-at-a-84-billion-valuation-2019-4-1028142318">
  a price range of $44 to $50 per share</a>. The company is
  expected to start trading in mid-May.
</p>
      <p>
  The ride-hailing company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/lyft">Lyft</a> went
  public at the end of March in an IPO that valued the company at
  $21 billion. It was followed by the IT-management company
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/pagerduty">PagerDuty</a>,
  which was valued at $1.76 billion.
</p>
      <p>
  Last week brought two IPOs: the videoconferencing company
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/zoom">Zoom</a>,
  with a $9 billion valuation, and the online-scrapbooking platform
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/pinterest">Pinterest</a>,
  which was valued at $10 billion.

  There's one area where almost everyone in the US overspends, and
  - spoiler alert - <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-daily-cup-of-coffee-ends-up-costing-in-long-run-2017-6">it isn't coffee</a>.
  It's not avocado toast either, for that matter.
</p>
      <p>
  The biggest chunk of the average American's budget goes toward
  housing, which accounts for about <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cesmy.nr0.htm">37% of take-home pay</a>. Many people
  spend <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-rent-afford-2017-6">even
  more</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  In some circumstances, spending a lot on rent or a mortgage is
  unavoidable. But in many cases, making a few sacrifices on
  housing expenses today could lead to significant savings - and
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-retire-by-income-2017-6">a
  far more comfortable future</a>.

      <p>
  
  Take, for example, Grant Sabatier, a 30-something self-made
  millionaire who founded the finance blog <a href="https://millennialmoney.com/">Millennial Money</a>. He was able
  to save about $25,000 in two years by cutting back on housing, as
  well as transportation and dining expenses.
</p>
      <p>
  "At the end of the day it comes down to a personal choice, but I
  was happy moving to a smaller apartment, moving closer to my
  office, and eating out less, to bank the difference," Sabatier
  <a href="https://millennialmoney.com/fast-track-financial-independence/">wrote
  on Millennial Money</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  He continued:
</p>
      <p>
  "While I don't have the exact figures, I estimate that cutting
  back for 2 years, before buying my first home, I was able to save
  about $25,000 that I invested in 2011 and 2012, and that 'cutting
  back' is now worth more than $100,000 in my investment accounts.
  I'm going to continue to let it grow and hopefully making that
  decision 2 years ago will compound in 20 years into a lot more
  money."
</p>
      <p>
  Saving enough over a 40-year career <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-retire-by-40-2017-6">to
  maintain your lifestyle in retirement</a> is challenging enough.
  There's no shortage of advice about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-to-save-in-every-decade-of-your-life-2017-3">
  how much you <em>should</em> be saving</a>, typically at least
  10% of your income. But many Americans come up short.
</p>
      <p>
  But there's a lot to be learned from people like Sabatier
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/a-self-made-millionaire-reveals-how-to-retire-in-10-years-or-fewer-2017-7/">
  who have managed to hit their savings goals</a> well before 65.
</p>
      <p>
  Rather than depriving yourself of coffee and avocado toast -
  though you might want to do that as well - take a hard look at
  how much you're paying for housing right now. If it's more than
  30% of your pretax income, the standard measure of housing
  affordability, it's time to make a change.
</p>
      <p>
  To make more progress on your savings goals, however, you'll want
  to limit your housing expenses even further. Look for a place
  that costs <em>25% or less of your after-tax income</em>, and
  funnel all of the cash you save toward <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/contribute-both-401k-and-ira-2017-7">
  your retirement accounts</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  In some parts of the country (hi, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/regions/new-england/northeast.htm">New York
  and the rest of the Northeast</a>), the percentage spent on
  housing can be even higher than the 37% average. But that doesn't
  mean it's impossible to find affordable options, even if you have
  to have multiple roommates or a longer commute.
</p>
      <p>
  Keeping housing costs low is smart, no matter how much money you
  have. The billionaire investor <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-modest-home-bought-31500-looks-2017-6">
  Warren Buffett lives in a modest house</a> worth 0.001% of his
  total wealth.
</p>
      <p>
  The best financial move you can make is to <em>literally</em>
  move to a less expensive home. Once you do, you can celebrate at
  your local coffee shop.

  <li>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2SAKxWu">Mighty Patch</a> is the best overnight acne solution
  I've tried in a decade-long search. 
  </li>
  <li>It's a Hydrocolloid patch that acts as a magnet for the gunk
  inside a blemish, best worn overnight.
  </li>
  <li>It also reduces exposure to germs, and is alcohol-, paraben-,
  and sulfate-free. Once the patch is removed, blemishes are
  drastically less severe.
  </li>
  <li>The new <a href="https://amzn.to/2tJbH3l">Invisible+ Mighty Patch ($17.99, 39-count)</a>
    is an ultra-thin iteration designed so you can wear them during
    the daytime. 
  </li>
  <li>All in all, they are less conspicuous, but people will
  probably still notice if they're prominently featured. If you
  plan on wearing them out in public, though, they're worth buying.
  
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  If you've dealt with acne before, somebody (or some company) has
  probably offered you the skin-care equivalent of "magic beans"
  before: an affordable acne solution that zaps away blemishes
  overnight. That means that every cursed pimple that shows up
  right before a big interview, night out, first nerve-racking
  date, or big beach vacation could be dealt with, damage blessedly
  erased, before it could really make any difference.
</p>
      <p>
  Like a mini Indiana Jones, I spent most of my pre-teen years
  engaged in a sprawling search for exactly this. I read the beauty
  articles, stalked the CVS aisles, and spent my minimum wage
  earnings on products that promised to be the next big thing. And
  while some were decently effective, none came within throwing
  distance of working overnight. Spot correctors like <a href="https://amzn.to/2XyngrK">Mario
  Badescu's famous Drying Lotion</a> helped me recover faster, but
  it was still days at a time. Discovering an <a href="https://amzn.to/2T9jtmn">affordable version of Differin</a> in my mid-twenties
  helped me <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/differin-acne-gel-review-2019-1">manage surface-level bumps within
  two days</a>. And a chance discovery of this <a href="https://amzn.to/2NzJqFG">cult-favorite Aztec Clay Mask</a> with over 11, 000
  five-star reviews <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/aztec-bentonite-clay-mask-review">has helped me stop most breakouts
  before they happen</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  But that still leaves the only kind of pimples I really cared
  about anyway - the ones that were a bit more severe than a light,
  surface-level irritation, and which you'd probably see someone's
  eyes wander to in a conversation. 
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>That's what I swear by Mighty Patch for, which I <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/products-we-bought-from-our-coworkers-reviews">bought immediately</a>. after
  reading <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mighty-patch-review-get-rid-of-pimple-acne-overnight-2018-4">this Insider Picks
  review</a>.</strong>
</p>
      <p>
  To be concise, Mighty Patch is simply the best fast acne solution
  I've ever found. They're Hydrocolloid stickers that suck the gunk
  out of blemishes overnight (or, as we'll get into later, during
  the day) if left on top of the blemish for a minimum of six
  hours. Originally used to treat wounds, hydrocolloid is a
  super-absorbent material now being put to use in gentle acne
  treatments - first in South Korea, where Hero Cosmetics' CEO and
  Co-Founder Ju Rhyu discovered them, and now in the US
  thanks in part to Rhyu's startup.
</p>
      <p>
  I put a Mighty Patch on at night before bed and wake up to a
  blemish that seems to have skipped three days of healing; it's
  not inflamed or raised, and it no longer appears to be active.
  They're gentle (vegan, alcohol-, paraben-, and sulfate-free),
  simple, and keep the germs from the outside world and your
  wandering hands away so blemishes can heal and stay healed. It's
  my personal "magic beans" product.
</p>
      <p>
  And now, Hero Cosmetics has released a Mighty Patch that can be
  worn during the day: <a href="http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;u=1088116&amp;m=79949&amp;urllink=www.herocosmetics.us%2Fproducts%2Fmighty-patch-invisible">the Invisible+ patches</a>.
  They're transparent, ultra-thin, matte to avoid reflecting light,
  and have tapered edges that blend seamlessly into the skin (find
  comparative photos below)<strong>.</strong> Now, you can treat
  pimples in as little as six hours, no matter when they appear -
  no waiting for the cloak of night to get down to business. 
</p>
      <h2>
  How to use Invisible+ Mighty
  Patches
</h2>
      <p>
  Cleanse the skin, pat it dry, and apply the mighty patch on top
  of your blemish. Leave it on for a minimum of six hours, either
  during the day or overnight if you choose. Remove it to throw
  away once the patch has turned opaque (aka sucked up all the
  impurities from that spot of your skin). 
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>What the <a href="http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;u=1088116&amp;m=79949&amp;urllink=www.herocosmetics.us%2Fproducts%2Fmighty-patch-invisible">Invisible+ Mighty Patches</a> are
  like in person</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  The Invisible+ Mighty Patches are the same technology as the
  originals, but much less conspicuous. They're thinner, more
  transparent (the originals have a yellowish hue) and matte so
  they don't catch and reflect light. They have tapered edges to
  help the patch blend more seamlessly into the skin. If you wear
  them during the day, you can add a bit of concealer on top to
  camouflage it effectively and avoid makeup being absorbed into
  the blemish.
</p>
      <p>
  If the Invisible+ patch is prominently featured (i.e. smack dab
  in the middle of your face), though, it's not going to magically
  look like skin close up. Having said that, though, it's
  preferable to me between making things worse with just concealer
  and going sans anything at all. And it'll likely go unnoticed in
  casual interactions - perfect for doing damage control on a
  surprise breakout while traveling, beach days, running errands,
  before a big job interview or date, or pretty much any other
  time. I've used them last-minute to address a surprise blemish in
  the morning and afternoon so I could go out with clear skin at
  night. 
</p>
      <p>
  Plus, the box includes two size options, so you can opt for a
  smaller patch for less severe blemishes. And, given their cult
  status, most people won't know what they are, and they're more
  likely to assume it's got more to do with a bandage than an
  active acne solution. But, ultimately, it's also good to note
  that it's not the end of the word even if someone does notice: as
  Hero Cosmetics' CEO Ju Rhyu, reminded me, "over 60 million
  Americans suffer from acne at some point so even though we hate
  it when we break out, it's a fairly normal thing." More often
  than not, we're all in the same boat.
</p>
      <p>
  My one cautionary note is to check them more frequently while
  you're out in the daylight if you don't dab concealer on top -
  once they turn opaque, they're much more noticeable, and you'll
  probably want to take it off.

  The Mighty Patch isn't as cheap as some of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/adult-acne-treatment-products-2018-6">our other favorite acne
  solutions</a>, but it is worth the extra money. It's gentle on
  the skin, relatively inconspicuous (as opposed to spot
  solutions), and it dwarfs blemishes overnight.

  you get 1 point. After 75 points, you'll get a free box of the
  originals, or $13 credit. With 150 points, you get one box of the
  originals and one of the Invisible+ or $31 dollars credit. If
  you'd rather earn points faster, refer a friend and earn 20 at

</p>
      <h2>
  The bottom line
</h2>
      <p>
  All in all, the Invisible+ are a bit less conspicuous than the
  originals, most so when they're first applied. However, if
  they're working, both the originals and the Invisible+ will
  eventually turn opaque and be far easier to spot - though, for
  what it's worth, the thinness of the Invisible+ is still less
  noticeable overall. For instance, having used both, I wouldn't
  wear the Mighty Patch Original out in public because of their
  thickness and color. I would, however, wear the Invisible+ in
  public if I thought I could get away with it based on the
  location of my acne.
</p>
      <p>
  Depending on your comfort level and where you need it (side of
  the face, chin, forehead underneath a baseball cap, etc.) and
  where you're going (beach, airplane, running errands) the
  still-there visibility may not matter anyway. Either way you
  break it down, the fact remains: the efficacy of the Mighty Patch
  is worth it. The added subtlety of the Invisible+ is worth it if
  you plan to wear them during the day or out in public.

  <li>TD Ameritrade, a brokerage with $1.2 trillion in assets under
  management, is building out a recommendation system similar to
  what Netflix has.
  </li>
  <li>By analyzing customers' trade data and portfolios, the system
  will make suggestions on news and educational content users
  should consume that's geared toward their trading strategies.
  </li>
  <li>TD Ameritrade hopes the system will increase engagement,

      <p>
  TD Ameritrade, one of the largest brokerages for Main Street, is
  building out a AI-based recommendation system similar to how
  Netflix suggests new shows that's aimed at helping customer's
  trade smarter.
</p>
      <p>
  Initially launched this year and dubbed the Content Intelligence
  Platform, the system currently makes recommendations on what type
  of educational content a customer should consume next based one
  what they've already shown interest in. Just like Netflix,
  clients can rate content they've read or watched to adjust the
  algorithms used to determine suggestions.
</p>
      <p>
  However, Vijay Sankaran, chief information officer at TD
  Ameritrade, which manages $1.2 trillion, told Business Insider
  that's just the beginning of what the system will be able to do.
  The Omaha-based brokerage is working on analyzing customer's
  trade data and portfolios to eventually offer suggestions on news
  that would be relevant to their investments.
</p>
      <p>
  "We want to use it in any way to help our investors get
  information more quickly," Sankaran said. "How do you really
  leverage the power of AI to ingest massive amounts of data
  quickly and then provide them with nuggets of insights based upon
  that."

  $1.2 trillion brokerage giant TD Ameritrade is working on
  a new technology similar to Domino's pizza tracker, and it could
  save them millions</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Recommendation systems stand to benefit both the customer and the
  company. In 2016, Netflix estimated its engine <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-recommendation-engine-worth-1-billion-per-year-2016-6">
  saved it more than $1 billion annually</a>. 
</p>
      <p>
  Sankaran said these types of suggestions increase engagement,
  which in turn leads to more trading activity, meaning additional
  revenue for the brokerage. 
</p>
      <p>
  However, arguably more important is its ability to draw more of
  the customer's business to TD Ameritrade. Consumers have no lack
  of options when it comes to personal investing, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hbsc-roboadvisors-report-on-breakeven-2019-3">
  thanks in large part to the rise of robo advisors in recent
  years</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  Sankaran said a lot of TD Ameritrade's clients have accounts with
  multiple brokerages. The hope would be the recommendation engine
  would push customers to invest more with TD Ameritrade than other
  accounts, he added.
</p>
      <p>
  "More insights for our clients will make them more sticky to the
  platform," Sankaran said. "People will feel like, 'Ok, I can come
  to TD Ameritrade and get more insights than I have on a
  competitor of ours because we are really tailoring content to
  them." 
</p>

</p>

  As a self-directed brokerage, TD Ameritrade isn't allowed to
  offer clients investment advice on specific stocks. However,
  Sankaran said his team plans to eventually build the engine out
  so it can point users towards similar investments already in
  their own portfolio.
</p>
      <p>
  "It takes a lot of time to find out, 'Ok, if I hold equity in
  this company, what else is like it?' Sankaran said. "We'll, over
  time, expand it so that we can say, here are 10 companies that
  are like this company."

  <li>Philo, one of the US's cheapest pay-TV bundles, announced
  this week that it would soon scrap its $16-per-month package and
  sell only its $20 plan.
  </li>
  <li>It's one of the tough calls the 18-month-old streaming-TV
  service has had to make as it grapples with the challenges of
  live TV.
  </li>
  <li>In the past few months, internet-TV bundles from YouTube TV,
  DirecTV Now, Hulu, and FuboTV have hiked prices. Sling TV and
  PlayStation Vue also raised the costs of some of their plans last
  summer.
  </li>
  <li>"We were really trying to figure out, how can we avoid having
  to raise our price?" Philo CEO Andrew McCollum told Business
  Insider.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">Visit
    Business Insider's homepage for more stories.</a>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  When the internet-TV service Philo <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=businessinsider.com+philo&amp;oq=businessinsider.com+philo&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.1456j1j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">
  launched in November 2017</a>, it had the cheapest pay-TV bundle
  on the market in the US. For $16 per month, people could buy a
  smattering of 45 entertainment TV channels, such as AMC, HGTV,
  Food Network, MTV, and Comedy Central, and add on a small
  collection of other networks for an extra $4 per month.
</p>
      <p>
  A year and a half later, the streaming-TV company still has one
  of the most affordable options for live-TV services in the US but
  is being forced to scrap its least expensive offering. Philo
  <a href="https://about.philo.com/note/">announced in a note to
  customers</a> this week that it will no longer offer the
  $16-per-month plan. Starting on May 6, Philo will sell only its
  $20-per-month bundle that has 58 channels, 13 more than the
  discontinued offering. (People who sign up before then will be
  able to hold on to the old plan.)
</p>
      <p>
  The move comes as other internet-TV services, including YouTube
  TV, DirecTV Now, Hulu Plus Live TV, and FuboTV, have raised
  prices over the past few months. Last summer, PlayStation Vue and
  Sling TV also <a href="https://qz.com/1320213/streaming-tvs-skinny-bundles-are-getting-pricier/">
  hiked the costs of some plans</a>. Philo opted to nix its
  cheapest package rather than raise rates across the board.
</p>
      <p>
  "We were really trying to figure out, how can we avoid having to
  raise our price?" Philo CEO Andrew McCollum told Business Insider
  in an interview in New York on Tuesday. "We're subject to some of
  the same forces that some of our competitors are. Our costs do go
  up. That's a challenge. We had to figure it out."
</p>
      <p>
  It's one of many tough calls the 35-year-old CEO, who was
  <a href="https://mashable.com/2015/02/04/andrew-mccollum-facebook/">
  part of Facebook's founding team</a>, has had to make since
  joining Philo in 2014.
</p>
      <h2>
  A sports-free TV bundle
</h2>
      <p>
  The TV company got its start delivering live TV to college
  campuses before launching the broader streaming service in 2017.
  Its aim with the broader platform was to package channels that
  were popular but wouldn't break the bank. Philo was going after
  people, including the young college students its business was
  built on, who weren't buying bigger cable bundles.
</p>
      <p>
  It looked at its viewing data from college campuses and found
  that entertainment channels offered the most bang for their buck.
  The company mostly offered entertainment channels from
  network operators who also became its investors, including
  A&amp;E, AMC, Discovery, and Viacom (Viacom also recently
  <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/viacom-pluto-tv-acquisition-1203114773/">
  acquired another streaming-TV company</a>, Pluto TV, which is
  free with ads). It carried independent networks, including the
  financial-news channel Cheddar and the food channel Tastemade, as
  well.
</p>
      <p>
  "Those channels on a pound-for-pound basis were, we felt, a
  much better value for their price to consumers," McCollum
  said.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/streaming-service-xumo-tv-grew-revenue-300-over-the-past-year-2019-4">
  The CEO of a free TV service that's riding the wave of
  ad-supported streamers reveals how the company achieved 300%
  growth in the past year</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Philo avoided the more expensive sports and news networks, such
  as ESPN, Fox News, and CNBC.
</p>
      <p>
  "Every year, the price of sports content increases and becomes a
  larger and larger share of the cable package," McCollum said.
  "The people who don't care about that content shouldn't have to
  basically subsidize the cost of it for everybody else."
</p>
      <p>
  Like other pay-TV services, Philo licenses channels, including
  those from its investors, usually for a fee. Pay-TV companies
  typically renegotiate those fees with the networks every year or
  so and pass the costs onto customers in the form of higher
  monthly bills.
</p>
      <p>
  In Philo's case, it chose to eliminate the cheaper $16 offering
  this time around instead of hiking rates. The margins were worse
  on the skinnier package. McCollum said Philo's subscriber base
  was pretty evenly split between the $16 and $20 plans. He
  declined to share how many subscribers the service has but said
  its subscriber base had been growing an average of 30% per month
  since launch. The company makes money through a combination of
  subscription and advertising revenue. As of July 2018, Philo had
  raised about $95 million, according to the research firm
  PitchBook.
</p>
      <h2>
  Everything comes at a cost
</h2>
      <p>
  Even licensing entertainment channels, however, proved difficult.
  Network owners were leery of breaking up their TV bundles. If
  Philo wanted to add Bravo, McCollum said - using an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/bg57b5/hey_quick_update_from_andrew_ceo_of_philo_tldr/elirkbu/?context=3">
  example he was recently asked about</a> on Reddit - it would also
  need to license other networks from Comcast's NBCUniversal, such
  as regional sports networks, the broadcast network NBC, and the
  news channels CNBC and MSNBC.
</p>
      <p>
  "The way that TV deals had been done for a long time affects your
  choices," McCollum said. "You don't actually have the freedom to
  create whatever packages you want, so you have to look at the
  trade-offs."
</p>
      <p>
  There are other trade-offs, too. When Philo began selling its
  subscriptions through Roku's and Amazon Fire TV's billing
  platforms, for example, it was able to offer only the $20
  subscription because there were costs associated with billing
  through those external platforms, McCollum said. It's similar to
  how Apple takes cuts from apps and subscriptions sold through its
  App Store.
</p>
      <p>
  McCollum said there was one upside to discontinuing the $16
  package.
</p>
      <p>
  "We could also have the same offering across the board and make
  it really simple for people," he said.
</p>
      <p>
  Moving forward, McCollum said the company is happy with its
  current channel lineup but will look to add more options when it
  makes sense. They will likely be add-ons to its base package. One
  day, the service might even offer sports or news.
</p>
      <p>
  "We don't have any real bias against sports or news," McCollum
  said. "We would love to offer more options if we can find a way
  to reach that trade-off of value and simplicity that we think
  consumers want."

    <strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/uber">Uber</a> filed
    an updated S-1 document as part of is IPO on Friday.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The company expects to lose at least $1 billion for the
    first quarter of 2019, on revenues of just over $3
    billion.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Friday's filing also disclosed the company's plan to
    sell shares between $44 and $50 per share, giving it a
    valuation near $90 billion. </strong>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/uber">Uber</a>
  expects its first quarter financial losses to be at least $1
  billion and as high as $1.11 billion, the ride-hailing giant
  <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000119312519120759/d647752ds1a.htm#toc647752_9">
  said in an updated IPO filing Friday morning.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  Revenue for the first three months of 2019 should be between
  $3.04 billion and $3.10 billion, Uber said, up from $2.58 billion
  in the same quarter of the previous year.
</p>

      <p>
  Unlike
  the previous three years of financial data included in Friday's
  filing (and all quarterly filings after a company goes public)
  the data released by Uber on Friday has not been audited by the
  company's outside accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</p>
      <p>
  "The expected net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. is
  due to increased loss from operations for the three months ended
  March 31, 2019 due to continued investment in our Core Platform,
  including increased incentive and promotion spend," the company
  said.
</p>
      <p>
  "Additionally, net income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.
  for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was impacted by $3.2
  billion of gains from the divestitures of our Russia/CIS
  operations and our Southeast Asia operations, as well as a $2.0
  billion unrealized gain on our investment in Didi during the same
  period."
</p>
      <p>
  Going forward, the company says its "Core Platform Contribution
  Margin" will be between -4% and -7%. For the first quarter, that
  loss was impacted by "increased competitive pressures in certain
  markets," Uber said, as it "increased our incentive and promotion
  spend to maintain our competitive position relative to prior
  periods."
</p>
      <p>
  In other words, Uber is acknowledging the ongoing pricing war
  between itself and Lyft, easily its biggest competitor in the
  United States. Both companies have been aggressively offering
  discounts and other incentives to keep people riding and not
  jumping ship to a competitor.
</p>
      <p>
  Core Platform Contribution Margin isn't a financial
  measure, but Uber says it's a good indicator of performance since
  it "does not include indirect unallocated research and
  development and general and administrative expenses (including
  expenses for ATG and Other Technology Programs)."
</p>
      <p>
  Uber's updated filing on Friday is also the first time the
  company has disclosed the number of shares it expects to offer in
  its IPO, which could reportedly commence as soon as next month.
  The <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uber-is-going-public-at-a-84-billion-valuation-2019-4-1028142318">
  company expects a roughly $90 billion valuation, at $44 to $50
  per share, raising upward of $10.3 billion in the process.</a>

  In personal finance, time is more than a four-letter word; it's
  the simplest and most reliable tool we have for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-way-to-build-wealth-2019-3">
  building wealth</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  When Bankrate asked Americans about their <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/financial-security-may-2018/">
  biggest financial regrets</a>, not saving early for retirement
  topped the list. 
</p>
      <p>
  It may sound premature to squirrel away money for retirement in
  your 20s (or even earlier) - hey, it's <em>decades</em> away -
  but a few years could make a difference of tens of thousands of
  dollars, or more, thanks to compound interest.
</p>
      <p>
  Compound interest is a form of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/exponential-growth-moores-law-compound-interest-2019-2">
  exponential growth</a> that rewards savers and investors,
  particularly those who act early. It's the snowball effect: As
  you roll a snowball down a hill, it gathers more snow. Not only
  does the original snowball grow in size, so does each additional
  pack.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/when-can-i-retire">Here's
  exactly how to figure out when you can retire</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Consider the following example and the chart below. Chris and
  Jennifer both invest $100 a month at a 5% annual compound
  rate of return. Chris begins investing at age 25,
  putting away $100 every month until 65 and Jennifer begins saving
  $100 a month at age 35.
</p>
      <p>
  An extra ten years of saving means that Chris has about
  $162,000 in his bank account, while Jennifer has $89,000 by the
  time she is 65. Chris' balance is nearly double Jennifer's, and
  he only contributed $12,000 more of his own money.
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c54bdf6d7ab6720e673830e-1536-1152.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <cite>Business Insider/Andy Kiersz</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  Now, if Chris and Jennifer incrementally increase their monthly
  contribution as they grow older - perhaps bumping up their
  savings rate by a small percentage with every pay raise - they'll
  wind up with even more money in that account at retirement.
</p>
      <p>
  Plus, investing in the stock market - whether directly or through
  a retirement account such as a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-save-for-retirement-couple-401k-2019-3">
  401(k)</a> - may yield a rate of return that's even higher than
  5% in some years. Historically, the stock market has averaged a
  7% rate of return, adjusting for inflation.
</p>
      <p>
  Saving in a tax-advantaged retirement account, such as an
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sep-ira-solo-401k-save-for-retirement-self-employed">
  IRA or 401(k)</a>, can give your money an even greater boost.
  Those types of accounts are funded with pretax money, so your
  full dollar will have the opportunity to compound.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rollover-ira-401k-rollover">A
  simple strategy can make retirement savings less complicated, no
  matter how many jobs you've held and accounts you've
  opened</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Time is a common element in the portfolios of many <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-save-more-income-advice-2019-3">
  successful savers</a>. <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190327005057/en/Secrets-Super-Savers-Revealed">
  TD Ameritrade recently asked</a> 1,500 Americans with
  investable assets of at least $250,000 about their saving
  strategies. About 20% of this group are "supersavers" who save or
  invest an average of 29% of their income, while everyone else
  saves an average of just 6%. More than half (54%) of
  supersavers who invest started before age 30, the survey found,
  while only 40% of others did the same.
</p>
      <p>
  Hope isn't lost if you missed the boat in your 20s.
  Starting to save now, wherever you are in your timeline, is
  better than starting tomorrow or next week. It takes great
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-habit-for-building-wealth-patience-2019-4">
  patience to build wealth</a> and there's no replacement for lost
  time.

      <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Lauren Lyons Cole is a financial planner in New York
    City</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>When she first meets a client, she asks them two
    questions seemingly unrelated to money: "What is your favorite
    Starbucks drink order?" and "What are your goals?"</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>She finds the answers to those questions give her
    insight about how client spends and saves, and how to craft a
    strategy to help them get what they want.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">Visit
    Business Insider's homepage for more stories.</a></strong>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  When I start working with a new client, I need to know everything
  - and I mean everything - about their finances. From monthly
  expenses to account balances to credit card interest rates, no
  detail is too small.
</p>
      <figure class="op-interactive">

                </figure>
      <p>
  But before we get into the financial minutiae, I ask two
  questions that have nothing to do with money, yet tell me more
  than a pile of bank statements ever could.
</p>
      <h2>
  1. What is your favorite Starbucks drink order?
</h2>
      <p>
  In many ways this is a simple question. I've learned over time
  that caffeine comes in handy when talking about personal
  finances. Without it, the risk of glazed-over-eyes syndrome
  increases significantly, especially during the first meeting. So,
  I always come prepared with the client's beverage of choice. 
</p>
      <p>
  But, truth be told, I have an ulterior motive for asking this
  question. What you buy at Starbucks reveals something to me about
  how you spend your money. 
</p>
      <figure class="op-interactive">
                
                <iframe><script async type='text/javascript' id="myFinance-widget-script">!function(){function e(){var e=document.createElement("script"),n=document.getElementById("myFinance-widget-script"),a=t+"static/widget/myFinance.js";e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src=a,n.parentNode.insertBefore(e,n);var c="myFinance-widget-css";if(!document.getElementById(c)){var d=document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0],i=document.createElement("link");i.id=c,i.rel="stylesheet",i.type="text/css",i.href=t+"static/widget/myFinance.css",i.media="all",d.appendChild(i)}}var t="https://www.myfinance.com/";document.attachEvent?document.attachEvent("onreadystatechange",function(){"complete"===document.readyState&&e()}):document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",e,!1)}();</script><div class="myFinance-widget" data-widget-id="d8c4d306-acaa-4f40-8143-1949a50c55fd" data-campaign="bi-cap-one-aff"></div></iframe>
                
                </figure>
      <p>
  
  In my experience, if you prefer a basic drink like a venti black
  coffee or a tall cappuccino, you're probably not a big spender in
  other areas. If your order is more elaborate, like a venti iced
  skinny hazelnut macchiato with sugar-free syrup and light ice,
  then I'll brace myself for a conversation about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/money-management-bill-paying-strategies-2016-12">
  budgeting and scaling back</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  And, if you respond by telling me how much you hate
  Starbucks and only drink premium espresso from a pricey
  independent cafe, then I'll expect to have a frank discussion
  about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-to-save-in-every-decade-of-your-life-2017-3">
  maxing out your retirement accounts</a> because your disposable
  income may be higher than it should be.
</p>
      <p>
  These are just observations of course, and are not based on any
  kind of data or science. I ask many more questions during the
  meeting to get an accurate perspective on a client's approach to
  spending. But more often than not, the Starbucks question holds
  true.
</p>
      <h2>
  2. What are your goals?
</h2>
      <p>
  Financial planning should never be a cookie cutter experience.
  Before I start calculating a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-automated-savings-is-the-key-to-building-wealth-2016-12">
  savings strategy</a> for a new client, I have to understand their
  goals.
</p>
      <p>
  If you want to get married, buy a home, and start a family in the
  next five years, your financial plan is going to look a lot
  different from someone who dreams of visiting 30 countries before
  turning 30. 
</p>
      <figure class="op-interactive">
                
                <iframe><script async type='text/javascript' id="myFinance-widget-script">!function(){function e(){var e=document.createElement("script"),n=document.getElementById("myFinance-widget-script"),a=t+"static/widget/myFinance.js";e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src=a,n.parentNode.insertBefore(e,n);var c="myFinance-widget-css";if(!document.getElementById(c)){var d=document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0],i=document.createElement("link");i.id=c,i.rel="stylesheet",i.type="text/css",i.href=t+"static/widget/myFinance.css",i.media="all",d.appendChild(i)}}var t="https://www.myfinance.com/";document.attachEvent?document.attachEvent("onreadystatechange",function(){"complete"===document.readyState&&e()}):document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",e,!1)}();</script><div class="myFinance-widget" data-widget-id="d8c4d306-acaa-4f40-8143-1949a50c55fd" data-campaign="bi-cap-one-aff"></div></iframe>
                
                </figure>
      <p>
  
  The goals have to come first, then the money follows. Once I know
  a client's vision for the future, I can do the math on how to get
  there from here. Spoiler alert: You might have to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-daily-cup-of-coffee-ends-up-costing-in-long-run-2017-6">
  give up your daily coffee</a>, unless you'd rather cut back in
  other areas. It's not my job to tell you how to spend it
  day-to-day, as long as you're on track to meet your goals.
</p>
      <p>
  Don't worry though. If you do give up buying coffee, I'll still
  have a venti iced skinny hazelnut macchiato with sugar-free
  syrup and light ice for you next time we meet.

  PayPal will invest $500 million in Uber, the ride-hailing company
  revealed in an updated IPO filing on Friday.
</p>
      <p>
  Uber is preparing to go public on the New York stock exchange,
  and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uber-is-going-public-at-a-84-billion-valuation-2019-4-1028142318">
  set its share price at $44 to $50 per share</a> in an amended S-1
  filing to the SEC. At the high end, this price would peg Uber's
  valuation at around $84 billion to $90 billion.

  Uber driver says he feels vindicated as his fight for the minimum
  wage is listed as a risk factor in its $100 billion IPO</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  According to the filing, PayPal has agreed to invest in Uber
  through a private placement at the IPO price. 
</p>
      <p>
  In its filing, Uber wrote: "PayPal, Inc. has entered into an
  agreement with us pursuant to which it has agreed to purchase
  $500 million of our common stock in a private placement at a
  price per share equal to the initial public offering price. This
  transaction is contingent upon certain closing conditions,
  including the closing of this offering and certain regulatory
  approvals."
</p>
      <p>
  PayPal is already an Uber payments partner and, along with the
  funding, will deepen its ties to the ride-hailing firm. They've
  agreed to expand the existing partnership, and PayPal will
  explore helping Uber build out its digital wallet.
</p>
      <p>
  Dan Schulman' PayPal president and CEO, said: "This is another
  significant milestone on our journey to be a platform partner of
  choice, helping to enable global commerce by connecting the
  world's leading marketplaces and payment networks."
</p>
      <p>
  Uber's enormous public offering marks a run of tech IPOs that
  includes rival Lyft and Pinterest. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-lowers-its-valuation-target-again-11556238053?mod=e2tw">
  According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, its IPO will be the
  second biggest in tech history, behind Alibaba.
</p>
      <p>
  The ride-hailing firm's IPO is being closely watched for several
  reasons: the company has said it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-ipo/uber-unveils-ipo-with-warning-it-may-never-make-a-profit-idUSKCN1RN2SK">
  may never make a profit;</a> it still faces multiple regulatory
  and legal battles around the world, and main US peer Lyft has
  seen its share price plummet during its single month as a public
  company.
</p>
      <p>
  "We are still barely scratching the surface when it comes to huge
  industries like food and logistics, and how the future of urban
  mobility will reshape cities for the better," wrote CEO Dara
  Khosrowshahi in the filing.

    <strong>Emily Samuel, a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/fitness">celebrity fitness trainer</a>, says
    there's no magic solution for healthy eating - she recommends

    meals</a>.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>One of her favorite inexpensive at-home cooking
    "tricks" is mixing up protein-packed no-bake breakfast
    balls.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Samuel said that the "no-bake little healthy balls that
    I make, that take literally five minutes, last me all week;
    that's my breakfast every day."</strong>

</ul>
      <p>
  Emily Samuel, a celebrity fitness trainer, isn't one to sugarcoat
  her nutrition advice. She says you can't cheat your way to
  healthy eating.
</p>
      <p>
  Samuel is a trainer to stars like Karlie Kloss and models for
  Victoria's Secret who flock to Dogpound, an exclusive Manhattan
  gym <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dog-pound-gym-2017-3">named in honor of Hugh Jackman's French
  bulldog</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  "I'm going to say what everyone doesn't want to hear," she told
  Business Insider. "Prepping meals, the thing that's most annoying
  to do? In fact, that's what's going to help you."
</p>
      <p>
  Scientific research backs Samuel up on that: <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-a-livable-future/news-room/News-Releases/2014/Study-Suggests-Home-Cooking-Main-Ingredient-in-Healthier-Diet.html">People who eat more home-cooked
  meals</a> consistently consume less sugar, eat healthier
  ingredients overall, and take in fewer calories (even when they
  do wind up eating out).
</p>
      <p>
  Samuel said that before she heads out the door in the morning to
  work out or meet her clients, she grabs a few refrigerated
  no-bake protein balls.
</p>
      <p>
  "It's my little secret," she said. "These no-bake little healthy
  balls that I make, that take literally five minutes, last me all
  week; that's my breakfast every day."
</p>
      <h2>
  Here's the simple mix-and-chill recipe that Samuel recommends
</h2>
      <p>
  The five core ingredients are:
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>1 cup of rolled oats (which are a great source of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/healthy-fats-in-food-2018-7#whole-eggs-1">healthy fat, protein, and
    calcium</a>)
  </li>
  <li>1/2 cup of cacao chips
  </li>
  <li>1/2 cup of chia seeds (which are high in healthy
  polyunsaturated fats and <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/chia-seeds/">
    filled with omega-3s</a> that can help lower your cholesterol)
  </li>
  <li>1/2 cup of peanut butter (or another nut butter of your
  choice)
  </li>
  <li>1/3 cup of honey (or agave nectar)
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  If you like, you can also add:
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>A teaspoon of vanilla extract
  </li>
  <li>A touch more oats if the mix seems too wet
  </li>
  <li>A little extra nut butter if the consistency is too dry
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  Mix these ingredients in a bowl. After that, Samuel said, "you
  roll them up into a ball, you put them in the fridge, and then
  voila!"
</p>
      <p>
  You can use an ice-cream scoop or spoon to form the balls, making
  each one about the size of a golf ball. Then freeze them for an
  hour if you're pressed for time, or refrigerate overnight.
</p>

          <h1>No-bake protein balls require little prep.</h1>
          <cite>Shutterstock</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  Samuel also likes to add some protein powder to her balls, but
  you don't have to. There's still a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/101/6/1317S/4564491">vigorous debate in the nutrition
  community</a> about how much protein we really need in our diets,
  and many experts are stressing the importance of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096">eating whole, healthy foods</a>
  rather than relying on powders or worrying about specific
  nutrient groups like carbs, fats, and proteins.
</p>
      <p>
  Samuel said that to spice up her go-to breakfast-ball recipe, she
  sometimes uses almonds instead of chia seeds, sprinkles in a
  seasonal twist like pumpkin-pie spice, or adds some dried
  cranberries.
</p>
      <p>
  "You can even bring them to holiday parties," she said. "Be that
  cool person that brought the healthy thing."

  Kim Jong Un's sister, who is often referred to as the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-yo-jong-olympic-trip-photos-2018-2">
  "princess" of North Korea</a>, was mysteriously absent from her
  brother's side at his first-ever summit with Russian President
  Vladimir Putin this week, further fueling rumors of a fall from
  favor.
</p>
      <p>
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-jong-un-north-korea-ruling-politburo-sister-demotion-2019-4">
  Experts speculated earlier this month</a> that Kim Yo Jong, who
  was considered the most powerful woman in North Korea, had been
  demoted for an unknown reason.
</p>
      <p>
  She was not listed as an alternate member of North Korea's
  ruling Workers' Party of Korea's (WPK) politburo - the party's
  top decision-making body - and did not appear at any high-profile
  events during an important party gathering earlier this month,

      <p>
  Kim rose to fame in 2017 after she was promoted to the head role
  of the WPK's propaganda department and became an alternate member
  of the WPK's politburo.
</p>
      <p>
  She has since accompanied her brother to multiple high-level
  international events, including his first summit with South
  Korean President Moon Jae-in in April 2018, and both his summits
  with US President Donald Trump in 2018 and 2019.
</p>
      <p>
  Kim Jong Un notably used his sister's pen to sign a joint
  agreement on denuclearization at his first meeting with Trump in
  Singapore in June 2018.

  Kim Yo Jong is not the only high-ranking North Korean who appears
  to have fallen out of favor with Kim Jong Un.
</p>
      <p>
  The North Korean leader's point man for nuclear talks, Kim Yong
  Chol, was frozen out of the Russia summit altogether, <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-usa-diplomats-analysis/north-korea-signals-shift-in-nuclear-diplomacy-kims-right-hand-man-sidelined-idUKKCN1S20HV">
  Reuters reported</a>. He is expected to hand over his portfolio
  in nuclear talks to other diplomats who previously held lower
  ranks.
</p>
      <p>
  Kim is a common Korean surname; the nuclear official does not
  appear to be related to North Korea's ruling family.

  Mounting US-North Korea tensions

      <p>
  Kim Yong Chol's apparent demotion suggests that Pyongyang is
  looking to stop relying on the US and turn to other countries to
  negotiate its nuclear development.
</p>
      <p>
  Pyongyang has taken a hard line against the US recently and has
  appeared to plow on with its nuclear development after <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-us-summit-photos-details-kim-jong-un-trump-vietnam-2019-2">

  down</a>.

  claimed to have tested a new tactical guided weapon</a> earlier

  The Washington Post reported</a> that Pyongyang had <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-billed-the-us-2-million-for-hospitalizing-otto-warmbier-2019-4">
  demanded $2 million from the US</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-billed-the-us-2-million-for-hospitalizing-otto-warmbier-2019-4">

  2017 after he was accused of stealing a propaganda poster from
  his hotel during a visit to the country.
</p>
      <p>
  Warmbier was returned home in a coma and died shortly after his
  return to the US. Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1121733749757087750">tweeted

  Warmbier, not two Million Dollars, not anything else."

      <p>
  North Korea has long argued that the US' policy of "maximum
  pressure" sanctions harmed mutual relations and has long tried to
  relax international sanctions against the regime.
</p>
      <p>
  Trump said Kim had demanded a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-says-north-korea-summit-collapsed-kim-wont-close-nuclear-sites-2019-2?r=US&amp;IR=T">full
  relaxation of international sanctions</a> on his
  country in exchange for only a few nuclear site closures.
</p>
      <p>
  But North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said Pyongyang
  had only <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-contradict-trump-on-sanctions-second-kim-jong-un-meeting-2019-2">asked
  for a partial lifting of sanctions</a>, and that North Korea
  offered to dismantle some nuclear sites and testing, but the US
  demanded more.

  Un played out in Vietnam</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  It's not clear if Kim asked Putin to help relax international
  sanctions on North Korea this week, but it likely would not have
  worked. Moscow has remained committed to keeping sanctions
  in place until North Korea dismantles its nuclear program.

  Hours after Joe Biden formally launched his bid for the
  presidency on Thursday, President Donald Trump greeted the news
  in characteristic fashion - with a series of personal insults
  about the former vice president.
</p>
      <p>
  "Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe," Trump tweeted. "I only hope you
  have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful
  primary campaign.
</p>
      <p>
  "It will be nasty - you will be dealing with people who truly
  have some very sick &amp; demented ideas. But if you make it, I
  will see you at the Starting Gate!"
</p>
      <p>
  In Biden's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-2020-video-declares-battle-with-trump-for-soul-of-this-nation-2019-4?r=US&amp;IR=T">
  video announcing his candidacy</a>, he framed the prospect of
  four more years of a Trump presidency as a threat to US
  democracy, seizing on images of white nationalists - whom Trump
  did not unequivocally condemn -marching in Charlottesville,
  Virginia, in August 2017.
</p>

      <p>
  Trump resumed his attacks later in <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/hannity-has-trump-give-his-hot-takes-on-2020-dems-mayor-pete-is-not-going-to-make-it/">
  an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity</a>, saying he had been
  urged to smear Biden with another word that rhymes with "sleepy"
  (an allusion to the "creepy Joe Biden" memes that play on some
  women's accusations of inappropriate touching).
</p>
      <p>
  Trump said he ultimately decided the strategy was "too nasty,"
  continuing the unwelcome optics of seeming to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-mocks-joe-biden-offers-fake-sympathy-over-touching-allegations-2019-4">
  sympathize with Biden over issues having to do with the treatment

  The president's attacks, though, reportedly mask an underlying
  fear that Biden is the Democrat best placed to defeat him in
  2020.
</p>
      <p>
  A Republican strategist said to have direct knowledge of events
  in the White House <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/25/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-1290338">
  told Politico on Thursday</a> that the president had been
  discussing the threat Biden posed for months.
</p>
      <p>
  "How are we gonna beat Biden?" the president would reportedly
  ask, apparently not reassured even when aides suggested Biden
  wouldn't defeat his more left-leaning competition in the
  Democratic primaries.
</p>
      <p>
  The source of Trump's concern is the Democrat's credibility in
  the Rust Belt swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and
  Pennsylvania - which Trump took from the Democrats in 2016 after
  promising a renewal of blue-collar manufacturing jobs.
</p>
      <p>
  A source of particular concern is Pennsylvania, which, despite
  his long stint as a US senator for Delaware, is Biden's home
  state.
</p>
      <p>
  A Republican who has attended meetings with Trump told CNN on
  Thursday that Trump frequently asked about Biden's strength
  there.
</p>
      <p>
  Biden visited Pennsylvania on the first day of his presidential
  campaign, heading to a fundraiser held by David L. Cohen, the
  executive senior vice president of Comcast. He is expected to
  make his first major stump speech as a presidential candidate on
  Monday in Pittsburgh.
</p>
      <p>
  The president earlier retweeted a message by the Republican Party
  chair, Ronna McDaniel, highlighting the administration's economic
  record in the state.
</p>
      <p>
  "Biden chose Pennsylvania to launch his campaign - a state where
  the unemployment rate just dropped to the lowest level *ever
  recorded*," she tweeted.
</p>
      <p>
  National polls seem to bear out the president's concern, with a
  <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2019/04/24/joe-biden-is-the-front-runner-over-democrats-and-donald-trump/">Politico/Morning Consult</a> poll
  last weekend of registered voters showing Biden with an 8-point
  lead over Trump in a head-to-head contest.
</p>
      <p>
  Analysts, though, are skeptical about whether Biden, at 76, can
  command the support of the party's young, left-leaning, energized
  base in seeking the Democratic nomination.
</p>
      <p>
  He continues to be face questions about whether he is out of step
  with the values of the party.
</p>
      <p>
  One damaging example was Anita Hill telling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-hill.html">
  The New York Times on Wednesday</a> that she did not accept
  Biden's recent apology for his handling of Clarence Thomas' 1991
  Supreme Court confirmation hearings, in which she accused Thomas
  of sexual harassment.
</p>
      <p>
  Biden on Thursday refused to be drawn in to exchanging insults
  with the president, remarking to reporters in Delaware when told
  of Trump's tweet, "Everybody knows Donald Trump."

  <li>Jeremy Grantham, the cofounder and chief investment
  strategist at the $70 billion Grantham, Mayo, &amp; van Otterloo,
  has become a world-renowned market voice by calling every modern
  financial bubble - including the past two stock meltdowns.
  </li>
  <li>In a recent white paper, Grantham laid out his strategy for
  investing around climate change - one built around riding the
  wave of companies focused on fighting it.
  </li>
  <li>Grantham also discussed how this strategy can fit into
  portfolios that have varying objectives.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">Visit Business Insider's
    homepage for more stories.</a>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  Fighting <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/climate-change">climate change</a> is going to require
  trillions of dollars and decades of time.
</p>
      <p>
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/jeremy-grantham">Jeremy Grantham</a>, the cofounder
  and chief investment strategist at the $71 billion Grantham,
  Mayo, &amp; van Otterloo, sees this as an opportunity. And
  judging by his impeccable track record, his advice should be
  considered, if not heeded in full.
</p>
      <p>
  A world-renowned investor, Grantham has made his name by
  predicting major asset bubbles. He predicted the dot-com and
  housing bubbles that wound up crushing markets. In fact, his
  otherworldly prescience actually extends back to the late 1980s,
  when he called a bubble in Japanese equities and real estate.
</p>
      <p>
  Grantham says trillions of dollars will be deployed in a broad
  effort to transition away from the current global energy
  infrastructure and towards so-called clean energy. And when money
  is being spent, there's money to be made.
</p>
      <p>
  "As return-oriented investors, we see this effort providing the
  backdrop for decades of secular growth in the climate-change
  sector, along with the potential for strong returns," Grantham
  and his colleague <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=82307789&amp;privcapId=145606102&amp;previousCapId=145606102&amp;previousTitle=GMO%20Trust%20-%20GMO%20Resources%20Fund">Lucas White</a> wrote in a recent
  <a href="https://www.gmo.com/north-america/research-library/thinking-outside-the-box-how-and-why-to-invest-in-a-climate-change-strategy/">white paper</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  That partially stems from Grantham's expectation that the
  clean-energy shift will be rife with inefficiencies ready to be
  exploited.
</p>
      <p>
  "We believe that investors who do a good job of identifying the
  winners in the fight against climate change will be handsomely
  rewarded," he said.
</p>
      <p>
  But that's the simplistic way of looking at it. Grantham says
  there are a handful of other "significant" benefits his suggested
  climate-change strategy can offer. They can be broken down into
  four main categories, each of which is outlined below:
</p>
      <h2>
  (1) Diversification
</h2>
      <p>
  Grantham says one of the main selling points of his
  climate-change strategy is how decoupled it is from stock-market
  returns. While equities are driven largely by economic
  profitability and growth, he notes that the impetus behind
  climate change will be the switch to clean energy.
</p>
      <p>
  For that reason, Grantham sees such a strategy hanging tough
  during even the most difficult market enviroment.
</p>
      <p>
  "We expect to see periods where a climate change strategy
  performs well in a weak market and vice versa," he said. "If we
  told you we had identified an asset class that provided
  equity-like returns, perhaps better, in a manner quite different
  from the broad equity market, you would jump at the opportunity."
</p>
      <h2>
  (2) Protection from climate risk
</h2>
      <p>
  Even the Trump administration concedes that climate change is
  bound to take a bite out of the economy over the rest of the
  century. Grantham points out that as that transpires, the
  companies focused on preventing it will see their products and
  services in higher demand.
</p>
      <p>
  Green energy industries "will uniquely benefit from increased
  government intervention, not to mention from the ever-improving
  technology," he said.
</p>
      <h2>
  (3) Indirect exposure to fossil fuel prices and the inflation
  protection the industry provides
</h2>
      <p>
  If you're keen to adopt a climate-change strategy, it may seem
  like a no-brainer to start divesting from fossil fuels. However,
  that's easier said than done. Grantham notes that the outsized
  returns and inflation protection the industry has historically
  provided will be difficult to relinquish.
</p>
      <p>
  But he has a solution: investing in clean energy options that
  compete with fossil fuels.
</p>
      <p>
  "When fossil fuel prices rise, clean energy solutions become more
  competitive, and market forces accelerate the transition to
  them," Grantham said.
</p>
      <p>
  The chart below shows how this indirect exposure can be gleaned.
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc21949b14bf465cf6f4412-750-469.jpg"/>

          <cite>MSCI, Global Financial Data, GMO</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>
  (4) Growth at a discount
</h2>
      <p>
  All of the forces outlined above are great and all, but the
  ultimate objective of Grantham's strategy is to make money. To
  that end, he's appended this pillar of his strategy, which
  involves finding bargains in the investing universe he's already
  laid out.
</p>
      <p>
  While that may seem at first glance to be a traditional
  value-investing approach, Grantham notes that climate change on
  the whole is a high-growth area. Yet, despite that, he sees
  plenty of opportunity to pick out diamonds in the rough.
</p>
      <p>
  The chart below supports that idea:
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc21b62b14bf469f9690022-750-412.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <cite>Russell, GMO</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>
  How to weave a climate-change strategy into your existing
  portfolio
</h2>
      <p>
  So how can the aforementioned strategy be best tailored to your
  specific portfolio? Grantham lays out four possible avenues:
</p>
      <ol>
  <li>Global equity alpha
  </li>
  <li>Real assets allocation
  </li>
  <li>ESG, impact, and sustainable investments
  </li>
  <li>Downside insurance
  </li>
</ol>
      <p>
  "There are a variety of ways that such a strategy could fit into
  a portfolio," Grantham said. "It's up to investors to figure out
  how a climate change strategy fits into their particular
  investment process, but we expect it will be worth the effort."
</p>
      <p>
  He continued: "For those willing to think outside the box, we
  expect the rewards to be significant."

  <li>A blistering recovery in the stock market finally led it to
  record highs earlier this week.
  </li>
  <li>Albert Edwards, a global strategist at Societe Generale,
  warns that at least four features of this rally indicate a
  powerful meltdown is on the horizon.

  The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/stock-market">stock
  market</a> is enjoying its best start to a year since 1987. But
  according to several strategists, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-news-us-rallies-as-earnings-better-than-expected-2019-4-1028133580">
  the rally</a> is carrying symptoms of a sharp reversal - one they
  expect to soon follow.
</p>
      <p>
  Thanks to the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-news-us-rallies-as-earnings-better-than-expected-2019-4-1028133580">
  Federal Reserve's change of tune</a>, investors turned around the
  correction that ensued late last year, confident the central bank
  would not allow high interest rates to choke the economy.
</p>
      <p>
  Despite this powerful catalyst, strategists including Societe
  Generale's Albert Edwards have identified worrying traits of the
  rally that portend danger ahead.
</p>
      <p>
  In a recent note to clients, Edwards stacked himself against
  other experts, who are betting that the rally is a precursor of a
  continued melt-up that could accelerate if the ongoing earnings
  season outperforms expectations.
</p>
      <p>
  For those who would rather dismiss Edwards' ideas as the
  ramblings of another perma-bear, he reminded readers of a few
  prescient calls he made over a decade ago. He said that central
  banks would be forced to lower interest rates to zero in dealing
  with the next recession and that they would have to buy bonds to
  keep borrowing costs low.
</p>
      <p>
  Edwards is once again throwing his forecasts out there, drawing
  on research from other colleagues on Wall Street. Below are four
  things he would have investors keep in mind:
</p>
      <h2>
  1. The 'dumb money' is too bullish.
</h2>
      <p>
  This refers to the retail investors - usually placed in contrast
  with the "smart" institutions on Wall Street - who wait until a
  rebound is well underway before mustering the courage to buy
  stocks.
</p>
      <p>
  In other words, the dumb money gets exuberant and buys at the top
  for fear of missing out.
</p>
      <p>
  If the so-called Dumb Money Confidence Index is any indication,
  the stock market could be at another inflection point, according
  to Edwards. The index, compiled by Sundial Capital Research, is
  at its highest level since 2010. And according to the firm, the
  <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&amp;p_500">S&amp;P
  500</a> has seen a negative return within two to eight weeks of
  similar readings over the past 20 years.
</p>

        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <cite>Societe Generale</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>
  2. Volatility is extremely low.
</h2>
      <p>
  The lull doesn't exist only in the stock market, where it's
  gauged by the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/vix">Cboe Volatility
  Index</a>. Volatility in the dollar, Treasurys, and high-yield
  debt is also near historic lows.
</p>
      <p>
  But what makes stocks different from other asset classes is that
  periods of low volatility are usually followed by market declines
  - and these sell-offs tend to be more violent than upswings.
</p>
      <p>
  Edwards' point does not even factor in the market's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-investing-latest-sell-off-and-recovery-showed-paradigm-shift-jp-morgan-2019-4">
  constrained liquidity</a>, which could amplify the losses
  suffered during a surge in volatility.
</p>

        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc1fbf916c65a569c6b0f88-960-641.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <cite>Societe Generale</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>
  3. Some economic data is still lackluster.
</h2>
      <p>
  Edwards pointed out that stocks were rallying despite the decline
  of manufacturing data in developed countries including the US and
  Japan. Also, global trade volumes are slumping.
</p>
      <p>
  His explanation for why these trends run counter to the rally is
  that investors believe the Fed is now on their side - no longer
  raising rates on autopilot but willing to slam the brakes if need
  be.
</p>
      <h2>
  4. Stocks can rally - and have rallied - leading up to
  recessions.
</h2>
      <p>
  "Traditionally the equity market rallies after the final rate
  hike and any rally should be sold into if you believe the economy
  is headed into recession," Edwards said.
</p>
      <p>
  He continued: "The problem is that no-one ever forecasts <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/next-recession-bearish-signals-show-crisis-is-nearing-2019-2">
  imminent recessions</a>. The closely followed BAML Global Fund
  Manager Survey shows that in April 70% of investors surveyed
  expect a global recession to start in H2 2020 or later and most
  shocking, 86% believe yield curve inversion does not signal an
  impending recession! So are you going to pile into equities along
  with the 'dumb money?'"

  Facebook is cracking down on fake Instagram likes.  
</p>
      <p>
  The social network <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/04/preventing-inauthentic-behavior-on-instagram/">
  announced it had filed a lawsuit in a US federal court</a> on
  Thursday, which alleges that a New Zealand company called Social
  Media Series Limited and three of its directors used different
  companies and websites to sell fake likes, views, and followers
  to Instagram users.
</p>
      <p>
  This was done through websites that included SocialEnvy.co,
  IGFamous.net, and Likesocial.co, according to the suit.
</p>
      <p>
  "Through their business, Defendants [Social Media Series Limited
  and its directors] interfered and continue to interfere with
  Instagram's service, create an inauthentic experience for
  Instagram users, and attempt to fraudulently influence Instagram
  users for their own enrichment," the lawsuit said.
</p>
      <p>
  It continued: "Since July 2018, Defendants unjustly enriched
  themselves at the expense of Facebook and Instagram in the amount
  of approximately $9,430,000."
</p>
      <p>
  Facebook sent cease-and-desist letters to two of the company's
  directors in July and December 2018.

  Instagram will soon start cracking down on accounts that use
  third-party apps to dole out fake likes and followers</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  According to the lawsuit, Instagram users who wanted to inflate
  their followers, views, and likes could pay for automatic likes
  via Social Media Series' various websites. Fake likes would then
  appear almost immediately after a customer posted a photograph to
  Instagram.
</p>
      <p>
  The cost to the customer would depend on the number of likes
  being purchased, ranging from $10 to $99 per week, the lawsuit
  said. In its filing, Facebook gave examples of users who had
  gained 500 likes within seconds of posting something to
  Instagram.
</p>
      <p>
  Facebook now has multiple lawsuits in the works relating to
  individuals or companies that sell fake engagement on its social
  media platforms. 
</p>
      <p>
  In March, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-and-instagram-launch-lawsuit-over-fake-accounts-and-followers-2019-3?r=US&amp;IR=T">
  it filed a lawsuit against f</a><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-and-instagram-launch-lawsuit-over-fake-accounts-and-followers-2019-3?r=US&amp;IR=T">our
  companies</a> and three people based in China, alleging that they
  had promoted the sale of fake accounts, likes, and followers on
  Facebook and Instagram. 
</p>
      <p>
  "By filing the lawsuit, we hope to reinforce that this kind of
  fraudulent activity is not tolerated - and that we'll act
  forcefully to protect the integrity of our platform," Facebook's
  deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/sale-of-fake-accounts-likes-and-followers/">
  wrote</a> <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/sale-of-fake-accounts-likes-and-followers/">
  in a blog</a> post at the time.

      <p>
  In November 2018, Instagram said that it would also be targeting
  users who were paying for these fake likes.
</p>
      <p>
  "We've built machine learning tools to help identify accounts
  that use these services and remove the inauthentic activity. This
  type of behavior is bad for the community, and third-party apps
  that generate inauthentic likes, follows and comments violate our
  Community Guidelines and Terms of Use," it <a href="https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/11/19/reducing-inauthentic-activity-on-instagram/">
  wrote in a blog post</a>. 
</p>
      <p>
  The industry, in general, has been clamping down on what <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html">
  The New York Times</a> dubbed as "social media's black market."
  The Times' reporting on this sparked an investigation into a
  company that was selling likes and followers to celebrities and
  businesses to boost their status online.
</p>
      <p>
  The now-defunct Devumi LLC had more than 200,000 customers in its
  heyday, including reality television stars, professional
  athletes, comedians, TED speakers, pastors, and models, all of
  whom bought followers online. This case was settled in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/30/tech/new-york-attorney-general-social-media/index.html">
  January</a>. 
</p>
      <p>
  Twitter has also come under scrutiny for having fake accounts on
  its sites and has been <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/Confidence-in-Follower-Counts.html">
  taking steps</a> to remove them.

  <li>PepsiCo, the owner of Lay's potato chips, sued a small group
  of Indian farmers for growing a potato variety it says belongs to

  </li>
  <li>The food and drink giant says it has had exclusive rights to

  </li>
  <li>Dozens of activists and farmers' unions have written to

  <li>After a hearing on Friday, PepsiCo told Business Insider it

      <p>
  PepsiCo, the $177 billion owner of the potato-chip brand Lay's,
  sued a group of farmers in India for growing a variety of potato
  to which it says it owns the exclusive rights.
</p>
      <p>
  The company sought reparations of $143,000 each from four farmers
  accused of growing the <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20050081269A1/en">FL-2027
  potato</a>, which PepsiCo says it has had exclusive rights to in
  India since 2016, according to legal documents submitted to a
  district court in Ahmedabad, in the western Indian state of
  Gujarat, on April 11 <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/25/business/pepsico-india-potato-farmer-lawsuit/index.html">
  and seen by CNN</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  After a hearing in Ahmedabad District Court on Friday, PepsiCo
  said it had only taken legal action "as a last resort," adding
  that it will now seek to "amicably settle" with the farmers
  involved in the case.
</p>
      <p>
  A spokesman for PepsiCo India told Business Insider after the
  hearing:
</p>
      <p>
  "PepsiCo India has proposed to amicably settle with people who
  were unlawfully using seeds of its registered variety."
</p>
      <p>
  "The company was compelled to take the judicial recourse as a
  last resort to safeguard the larger interest of thousands of
  farmers that are engaged with its collaborative potato farming
  program.
</p>
      <p>
  "PepsiCo India remains deeply committed to resolving the matter
  and ensuring adoption of best farming practices."

      <p>
  "PepsiCo is India's largest process grade potato buyer and
  amongst the first companies to work with thousands of local
  farmers to grow a specific protected variety of potatoes for it,"
  a representative told CNN prior to the hearing.
</p>
      <p>
  "In this instance, we took judicial recourse against people who
  were illegally dealing in our registered variety."
</p>
      <p>
  PepsiCo said it has given permission to several hundred Indian
  farmers to grow the special potato but not to the farmers in the
  lawsuit.
</p>
      <p>
  Two of the farmers involved in the case were named as Fulchand
  Kachchhawa and Suresh Kachchhawa, both from near the city of
  Deesa, north of Ahmedabad in Gujarat.

  PepsiCo said the growing of FL-2027 without permission is a
  rights infringement under Section 64 of the Protection of Plant
  Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act 2001.

</p>
      <p>
  Lawyers, activists, and farmers unions have rallied to the
  farmers' defense.
</p>
      <p>
  More than 190 activists wrote a joint letter to the Indian
  Ministry of Agriculture opposing what they called the "false and
  untenable" lawsuit from the food and drink behemoth, <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/pepsico-india-lays-potato-farmers-gujarat-sued-1510090-2019-04-25">
  India Today wrote</a>. PepsiCo also owns brands such as Gatorade,
  Quaker Oats, and of course, Pepsi.
</p>
      <p>
  Activists are also raising legal aid to help the farmers fight
  the case.
</p>
      <p>
  One of the signatories, Kapil Shah of the advocacy group Jatan,
  told CNN that PepsiCo's actions were "against food sovereignty"
  and the "sovereignty of the nation."
</p>
      <p>
  "We will fight it out, no matter how big the company," Shah said.
  "Pepsi has made a huge mistake."

    <strong>This week iFixit released a damning teardown of

  <li>
    <strong>The teardown followed reports from reviewers that their

    <strong>iFixit announced on Thursday that it has removed its
    teardown at the request of Samsung.</strong>

      <p>
  Over the last two weeks, Samsung's reputation has taken a severe
  bruising over its flagship folding phone, the Galaxy Fold.
</p>
      <p>
  First four reviewers reported that their units <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-fold-reviewers-breaking-2019-4?r=US&amp;IR=T">
  broke after just two days of use</a>, prompting the company to
  announce that it was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-officially-delays-galaxy-fold-release-date-read-full-statement-2019-4?r=US&amp;IR=T">
  delaying the phone's release date</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  Then iFixit, a website focused on phone repairs and known for its
  technical "teardowns", <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-fold-teardown-shows-fragile-hinge-screen-design-2019-4?r=US&amp;IR=T">
  published a damning teardown of the Fold</a>, describing it as
  "alarmingly fragile." Samsung did not take this lying down.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-fold-hands-on-review-release-date-photos-2019-4?r=US&amp;IR=T">
  Review units of Samsung's $2,000 Galaxy Fold are already breaking
  - here's what it's been like to use so far</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  On Thursday <a href="https://ifixit.org/blog/16189/about-our-galaxy-fold-teardown/">iFixit
  published a blog</a> saying that it had taken down its teardown
  piece after, "two days of intense public interest."
</p>
      <p>
  "We were provided our Galaxy Fold unit by a trusted partner.
  Samsung has requested, through that partner, that iFixit remove
  its teardown," iFixit said in the blog. It stressed that the site
  was under no legal obligation to remove the post, but was doing
  so out of respect for the unnamed partner.
</p>
      <p>
  Samsung was not immediately available for comment when contacted
  by Business Insider.

  British holidaymakers were horrified when a man tried to open the
  door of a packed jet at 30,000ft.
</p>
      <p>
  Passengers and crew wrestled the man to the floor of the EasyJet
  plane after he began yanking at the emergency exit door of the
  Airbus A319.
</p>
      <p>
  The man, in his 30s, was forced into a seat and "boxed in" by
  other passengers, allowing the craft to safely touch down in
  Pisa, Italy on Wednesday.
</p>
      <p>
  Businessman Richard Conyard, 42, described how he noticed the man
  enter the toilet looking "a little nervous" and wearing a heavy
  coat.
</p>
      <p>
  "When he came out he went towards the emergency exit and grabbed
  the handle and tried to open the door," <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8941658/easyjet-brit-holidaymakers-door-panic/">he told The Sun.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  "One of the crew screamed at him to stop and other passengers
  started shouting and crying. Everyone was understandably very
  scared.
</p>

  on-board coffee pots to brew the world's first beer at 40,000
  ft</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  "A couple of guys went to help. I joined them. We bundled him
  into a seat," said Mr Conyard, adding that all passengers had to
  stay in their seats upon landing until police arrived.
</p>
      <p>
  If the door had opened, the sudden decompression could have
  sucked passengers out of the plane and seen the cabin temperature
  plummet dangerously low, according to experts.
</p>
      <p>
  EasyJet confirmed that the captain of Flight EZY8233 from London
  Gatwick to Pisa had asked police to meet the aircraft owing to
  the "disruptive behaviour of a passenger onboard during the
  descent."
</p>
      <p>
  Pisa Airport police said a man in his 30s from Siena, Italy had
  been questioned in connection with the incident.

    <strong>Netflix borrowed $2 billion in junk (not investment
    grade) bonds on Wednesday from investors hungry to get involved
    in the company. </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Positive market conditions have made Netflix's decision
    to sell more debt lucrative despite its non-stop cash burning
    spree.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The company's $12 billion debt pile and competition
    from streaming rivals is of little concern to investors and
    isn't likely to be anytime soon. </strong>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  You would think the increasingly competitive landscape for
  streaming platforms would dim the appeal of Netflix to bond
  investors but then again Stranger Things have happened. 
</p>
      <p>
  The streaming platform is under greater pressure to deliver
  audience growth figures following the launch of Disney+ recently,
  as well as sustained challenges to the company from rivals such
  as Amazon Prime and Hulu.
</p>
      <p>
  The market for content is becoming increasingly congested
  as a result, with Netflix issuing guidance that it would spend
  around $15 billion on content this year with a free cash flow
  deficit of $3.5 billion, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/netflix-content-spending-2019-15-billion-1203112090/">
  as reported by Variety.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  Netflix's latest offering to credit investors - a
  $2.24 billion bond issue was split into a $900 million dollar
  deal and a €1.2 billion ($1.34 billion) tranche both due in
  2029- attracted $6 billion in investor demand, highlighting the
  company's appeal, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-24/netflix-junk-bond-offering-is-said-to-draw-6-billion-of-orders">
  according to Bloomberg.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  It takes Netflix's total debt to $12.3 billion with the
  company making no plans to become cash flow positive until 2021
  as it continues to splurge on new content.
</p>
      <p>
  The deal was priced at par but is <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/netflix_incdl-notes_201818-29_regs-bond-2029-usu74079al58">
  now trading up nine cents on the dollar, meaning that its actual
  yield has been depressed given the increased bond
  price.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  The debt pile indicates that Netflix's leverage - the ratio
  of debt to earnings a company has - is now at 6 times, which
  would mark a record for the company's gross leverage, according
  to CreditSights, whose analysts are skeptical of Netflix's recent
  deal. Having high leverage means a company has more debt than
  assets available to pay off debts at a given time and has been a
  growing concern for the market as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-leveraged-loans-what-are-clos-and-should-you-be-worried-2019-3?r=US&amp;IR=T">
  leveraged debt levels have boomed in recent years. </a>
</p>
      <p>
  Netflix is a darling of debt markets. Creditors have been piling
  in to lend to the junk rated company, rated Ba3/BB-
  (sub-investment grade).
</p>
      <p>
  It's a continuation of the high yield (read: more risky) market's
  rise in prominence in recent years. Yield-hungry investors are
  searching for fresh options amid low interest rate offerings from
  global central banks making traditional options like US
  Treasuries less attractive. 
</p>
      <p>
  Importantly, Netflix's repeated issuance - it took out a
  similar $2 billion bond last October - makes it a highly liquid
  and attractive option, says John McClain, a portfolio manager at
  Diamond Hill Capital Management, a US investment firm that
  manages fixed-income funds.
</p>
      <p>
  "The current position for Netflix is great, the market has been
  starved for supply, and the Fed is effectively on a permanent
  pause," McClain said in an interview with Business Insider. "It
  makes them attractive to this market, they offer a compelling
  product and have been very successful compared with other
  unicorns." 
</p>
      <p>
  The high-yield market had been lucrative to tech stocks
  because financing has tended to be cheaper and more effective
  than selling more stock with other companies <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/giant-tech-firms-like-uber-tesla-are-lapping-up-junk-debt-and-demand-is-growing-2018-11?r=US&amp;IR=T">
  such as Tesla, SpaceX and WeWork taking a similar route in recent
  years.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  There are doubters. 
</p>
      <p>
  "We are concerned a misstep in its growth trajectory, while
  cash burn continues to mount, could result in material downside
  for Netflix bonds," CreditSights analysts Mary Pollock and Jay
  Mayers wrote in a note. "The impact of new competitors in the
  space is real."
</p>
      <p>
  But, McClain said, investors have been falling overs themselves
  to lend to companies like Netflix for years and would probably do
  the same again if they came back to market later this year to
  help fund their cash shortfall.

  <li>Shelves would quickly empty in British stores in the event of
  a no-deal Brexit on October 31, due to a shortage of warehousing
  in the run-up to Christmas.
  </li>
  <li>Retailers are planning to stockpile goods like food, clothes,
  and medicine in the run up to the United Kingdom's scheduled exit
  on Halloween, amid fears it could be a no-deal departure.
  </li>
  <li>However, many of the warehouses used to stockpile goods in
  the run-up to March 29 are now no-longer available, as they have
  already been booked for storing large quantities of stock needed
  for Christmas.
  </li>
  <li>The prospect of a no-deal Brexit still looms as political
  deadlock in Westminster continues.

      <p>
  LONDON - Shelves in British stores would quickly empty in the
  event of a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, due to the
  warehouse space required to stockpile goods already being largely
  booked up for the Christmas period, industry leaders involved in
  contingency planning have told Business Insider.
</p>
      <p>
  Much of the warehouse space previously allocated to cope with a
  no-deal Brexit at the end of March, is now unavailable for a
  no-deal exit on October 31, with much of it booked up to three
  years in advance.
</p>
      <p>
  One business leader familiar with the no-deal plans of British
  retailers said that one major food company had used warehouses to
  stockpile around 24,000 pallets of stock in the run-up to a
  potential no-deal exit in the spring.
</p>
      <p>
  However, none of this space is available at the end of the year,
  as it is already booked to cope with the strains of Christmas.
  Demand for many goods including food, clothes, and medicines
  rockets at this time of year.
</p>
      <p>
  They told Business Insider that warehousing space is "at maximum
  capacity over Christmas in any normal year," and that the risk of
  a no-deal Brexit in October was creating demand for additional
  space which does not exist.
</p>
      <p>
  "Christmas is already a difficult period... Brexit is a pain in
  the arse which has fucked everything up even more."
</p>
      <p>
  UK ministers and businesses have warned that leaving the European
  Union without a deal would slow down the movement of goods across
  the border and lead to temporary shortages of certain goods.
</p>
      <p>
  Although the six month delay to Brexit, agreed by Theresa May and
  European leaders this month, took the immediate threat of a
  no-deal off the table, businesses are worried about there being
  no breakthrough within that time.
</p>
      <p>
  Talks between the UK government and the opposition Labour Party
  are already close to collapse.
</p>
      <p>
  Meanwhile, the unofficial race to replace May as Conservative
  party leader and prime minister has ramped up, with those
  candidates in favour of a no-deal, such as the former Foreign
  Secretary Boris Johnson, leading the pack.

      <p>
  The numerous companies that intend to stockpile goods in the
  run-up to October 31 are set to activate their plans in July if
  Members of Parliament still haven't agreed on a Brexit Withdrawal
  Agreement.
</p>
      <p>
  Business leaders are concerned that while many companies are
  proactively planning for a Halloween no-deal, and have gained
  valuable experience from previous no-deal preparation, some have
  become complacent.
</p>
      <p>
  "To do it once was irksome. To do it twice in three weeks was a
  pain. Three times is going to be really, really difficult for
  businesses," a business figure who is working with May's
  government on Brexit told Business Insider.
</p>
      <p>
  They said that the House of Commons majority against no-deal has
  become a "reassuring balm" which was leading some company bosses
  to be less worried about the prospect of the UK leaving the EU
  without a deal.
</p>
      <p>
  "They say 'no it won't happen, they [MPs] have stopped it
  twice'," the business leader said.
</p>
      <p>
  Pauline Bastidon, Head of European Policy at the Freight
  Transport Association, said that a "late October [Brexit]
  presents particular challenges for the logistics sector, not
  least because of preparations for Christmas."
</p>
      <p>
  She told Business Insider that "stockpiling is likely to be an
  issue, not least because there is only a finite amount of
  warehousing space which could made available at relatively short
  notice, and logistics businesses are currently looking to
  identify additional options to ensure that the supply chain
  remains resilient throughout the period."
</p>
      <p>
  Opposition politicians have warned that the UK is dangerously
  unprepared for a no-deal Brexit.
</p>
      <p>
  Lloyd Russell-Moyle, Labour MP and supporter of anti-Brexit group
  Best For Britain, told Business Insider: "This is just another
  unintended consequence of the government's chilling lack of
  foresight."
</p>
      <p>
  He added: "It's clear no amount of planning will prepare Britain
  for a cliff-edge Brexit.
</p>
      <p>
  "Leaving without a deal at the end of October would cause
  irrevocable disruption to businesses, see jobs slashed and leave
  communities laid bare across the UK."

  The US Central Intelligence Agency created an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cia/">Instagram account</a> on
  Thursday and picked an image that depicts the agency's
  clandestine nature for its first post.
</p>
      <p>
  In the picture, various items are scattered across what appears
  to be an office cubicle.
</p>
      <p>
  A desk clock, an employee badge, and maps of Russia and China - a
  few items, save the 1970s-style wallpaper, look as if they belong
  in the typical workspace of a CIA analyst.
</p>
      <p>
  But as the picture's cryptic caption suggests, many of them have
  a hidden meaning: "I spy with my little eye...," the caption
  reads.
</p>
      <p>
  Many of the items belong to current CIA employees, according to
  <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cia-joins-instagram-and-posts-a-symbol-laden-first-picture/">
  CBS News</a>.

  <strong>Some of the items pictured include:</strong>
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>A photo of CIA director Gina Haspel from 1985 on a badge - in
  another <a href="https://twitter.com/JennaMC_Laugh/status/1121450710112055304">image</a>,
  the number 0911947 appears on the badge. The CIA first came into
  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/history-of-the-cia">operation</a>
  on September 18, 1947.
  </li>
  <li>A golden owl statue that represents Athena, the Greek goddess
  of wisdom.
  </li>
  <li>A desk clock's time shows 8:46 the <a href="https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/nycdata/disasters/wtc-2001.html">time</a>
  when American Airlines Flight 11 hit the North Tower of the World
  Trade Center during the terror attacks of September 11, 2001.
  </li>
  <li>A box containing cuff links that were used by a case officer
  and an asset. The two CIA employees reportedly never met each
  other and used the cuff links to identify each another.
  </li>
  <li>A plant to depict an intelligence "plant."
  </li>
  <li>The infamous classification stamp.
  </li>
  <li>Something that resembles a gray wig.
  </li>
  <li>A <a href="https://fam.state.gov/fam/06fam/06fam1780.html">burn bag</a>
  under the desk
  </li>
  <li>An image of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/obituaries/tony-mendez-dead.html">
    Tony Mendez</a>, a CIA officer who oversaw the brazen 1979
    rescue of six US hostages in Iran.
  </li>
</ul>

  "Joining Instagram is another way we're sharing CIA's stories and
  recruiting talented Americans to serve here," a CIA spokesperson
  said to CBS News. "Through the account, we'll give a peek into
  Agency life, but we can't promise any selfies from secret
  locations."
</p>
      <p>
  The CIA's public affairs team recently made another savvy move on
  social media by referencing a scene from HBO's "Game of Thrones."
</p>
      <p>
  Former CIA deputy director David Cohen appeared as an extra on
  the most recent episode of "Game of Thrones."

  Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a 2020
  presidential candidate, has proposed erasing a good portion of
  student-loan debt and providing free public college.
</p>
      <p>
  Her plan, released earlier this week, was met with mixed reviews
  on Twitter, with some users debating whether it was equitable to
  people who have already paid off their loans or who selected a
  different school to avoid education debt.
</p>
      <p>
  Meanwhile, some experts think a plan like Warren's could
  stimulate the US economy.
</p>
      <h2>
  What the big deal with student debt?
</h2>
      <p>
  Student debt in the United States ballooned to <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/default.htm">
  $1.57 trillion</a> in the last quarter of 2018. It's held by more
  than 40 million borrowers, according to the US Department of
  Education. In 2017, the average amount of <a href="https://www.studentdebtrelief.us/student-loans/student-debt-statistics/">
  debt held by a graduate was $28,500</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  This can lead debt-holders to postpone hitting some common
  benchmarks of adulthood (like buying a home), adding to long-term
  savings, or paying off other debt. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/01/suvery-finds-more-people-put-off-home-buying-due-to-student-debt.html">
  CNBC reported</a> that a Bankrate survey published earlier this
  year found that 73% of respondents had "delayed at least one
  major life milestone because of their student loan debt."

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>
  Warren's proposal is to lessen the burden on borrowers
</h2>
      <p>
  She said it would:
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>Cancel $50,000 of debt for those in households making less
  than $100,000 per year.
  </li>
  <li>Lessen the debt burden for those making between $100,000 and
  $250,000, canceling $1 of debt for every $3 in income above
  $100,000 - for example, if you made $160,000, $30,000 of your
  student-loan debt would be canceled. (No debt cancellation would
  be offered for those making more than $250,000, the top 5% of
  earners.)
  </li>
  <li>Prevent taxing the canceled debt as income.
  </li>
  <li>Make debt-holders with private loans eligible for debt
  cancellation.
  </li>
  <li>Provide tuition-free public college to help future
  generations stave off student-loan debt.
  </li>
</ul>

  Joe Biden's entrance into the 2020 presidential race will cause a
  seismic shift. Here are the rival contenders that are in the most
  trouble</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  <a href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/im-calling-for-something-truly-transformational-universal-free-public-college-and-cancellation-of-a246cd0f910f">
  Warren said in her blog post on Medium</a> that 75% of people
  with student-loan debt would have it canceled and 95% would see
  some relief.
</p>
      <p>
  Warren also shared <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Experts-Letter-to-Senator-Warren-.pdf">
  an economic analysis from Brandeis University</a>, which found
  that the plan would have "a substantial impact on student debt
  forgiveness and would greatly benefit households with the least
  ability to repay" and those for whom higher education was not a
  major benefit, as well as help lessen the racial wealth gap.
</p>
      <p>
  Additionally, the analysis said Warren's plan could boost the
  economy.
</p>
      <p>
  "It would likely entail consumer-driven economic stimulus,
  improved credit scores, greater home-buying rates and housing
  stability, higher college completion rates, and greater business
  formation," it said.

      <h2>
  What the experts say about Warren's proposal
</h2>
      <p>
  Josh Bivens, the research director at the progressive-leaning
  Economic Policy Institute, told INSIDER in an email that the
  plan's "short-run macro benefits are neutral to good."
</p>
      <p>
  "This would certainly boost spending by households, who would be
  wealthier (since debt has been extinguished) and have more
  disposable income since debt service payments are no longer
  needed," Bivens wrote. "There is definitely research indicating
  that student loan payments are holding back home and car
  purchases - particularly for young adults."
</p>
      <p>
  Bivens said that the overall effect, however, would depend on
  employment numbers and whether the Federal Reserve raises
  interest rates in response to more spending.
</p>
      <p>
  "My sense is that we still have a little bit of daylight between
  current conditions and unambiguous full employment - so the extra
  spending really would create some more jobs and income," he said.
  "And the Fed has signaled that it might wait until inflation
  shows up in the data before raising rates."

  In 2018, the <a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/SDR_PR_2_6.pdf">Levy Economics
  Institute of Bard College published research</a> on one-time
  student-debt cancellation, finding that "such a proposal could
  have significant benefits for the U.S. economy."
</p>
      <p>
  The researchers said that "student debt cancellation results in
  an increase in GDP, ranging from $861 billion to about $1,083
  billion over the entire period, or on average between $86 billion
  and $108 billion per year." It would also spur job creation.
</p>
      <p>
  However, their research focused on debt cancellation for
  everyone, unlike Warren's plan, which is income-based.

      <p>
  Not everyone is convinced that Warren's plan is the right way to
  give the economy a jolt. Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the
  Manhattan Institute, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/23/elizabeth-warren-and-2020-election-democrats-propose-student-loan-relief.html">
  told CNBC</a> that "we can think of better, more efficient ways"
  to provide an economic boost, adding that debt forgiveness often
  benefits mainly high earners.
</p>
      <p>
  The economist Ben Stein <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/elizabeth-warrens-free-college-plan-is-highly-irresponsible-ben-stein">
  told Fox Business</a> that the tuition-free-college aspect of the
  plan was "highly irresponsible."

      <h2>
  What about the cost of this plan? Will it increase the deficit?
</h2>
      <p>
  Bivens said that canceling all student loans would "boost the
  deficit by roughly $85 billion per year" for 10 years.
</p>
      <p>
  "To put this in some context, it's about a third as costly as the
  2017 Trump tax cut, in fiscal terms," he said.
</p>
      <p>
  The Levy Economics Institute's research suggested that the effect
  of canceling all student loans (which Warren's plan would not do)
  would be "modest," roughly 0.29% 0.37% of gross domestic product.
</p>
      <p>
  Brandeis University estimated that Warren's one-time
  debt-cancellation proposal would cost the government a lump sum
  of $640 billion, while providing free public college would cost
  roughly $1.25 trillion over a decade.

</p>
      <p>
  Warren also put forth a revenue plan for the proposal: "a 2%
  annual tax on the 75,000 families with $50 million or more in
  wealth" and 3% for those making more than $1 billion.
</p>
      <p>
  Over a decade, this could raise $2.75 trillion, according to
  Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, University of California
  economists <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/24/elizabeth-warren-propose-new-wealth-tax-very-rich-americans-economist-says/?utm_term=.11b7ce5780e7">
  who helped Warren with the proposal</a>.
</p>
      <h2>
  Student-loan debt is now front and center
</h2>
      <p>
  Whether voters are fans of the plan or not, Warren's proposal
  makes student debt a 2020 campaign issue - and one that 57% of
  millennials under age 30 view as a major problem, <a href="https://iop.harvard.edu/student-debt-viewed-major-problem-financial-considerations-important-factor-most-millennials-when">
  a Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics survey found</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  Bivens said that in his opinion, the economic benefits are not
  even the best argument for forgiving debt.
</p>
      <p>
  "I think the stronger reasons are fairness and (paired with
  Warren's plan to make college debt-free going forward) a
  potentially large boost to college availability, and hence a
  more-educated and productive (let alone happier) workforce in the
  future," Bivens said.

    <strong>The New York Giants used the sixth pick in the draft on
    Daniel Jones, a quarterback from Duke.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The NFL world was divided on Jones, whose resume isn't
    as impressive as some other quarterbacks in the draft. Some
    teams reportedly graded him as the best quarterback in the
    draft while others didn't have him in the top five.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The NFL world mocked the Giants' selection, as it added
    fuel to the fire in a controversial offseason.</strong>

      <p>
  The New York Giants made the long-awaited decision to draft a
  quarterback in the first round as a successor to Eli Manning, but
  few in the NFL world were impressed with the pick.
</p>
      <p>
  The Giants used the sixth pick in the draft to take Duke
  quarterback Daniel Jones, a somewhat divisive prospect, as there
  wasn't a consensus on where he ranked among quarterbacks in the
  draft.
</p>
      <p>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1121580743354875906">NFL
  Network's Tom Pelissero reported</a> that while some scouts
  considered Jones the No. 1 quarterback, others didn't have him in
  the top five.
</p>
      <p>
  The Giants have said that they would draft a quarterback who
  would one day replace Manning. Most thought a better choice would
  be Ohio State quarterback Dwayne Haskins.
</p>
      <p>
  Several reports indicated that the Giants liked Jones'
  personality and maturity. He was also coached by David Cutliffe
  at Duke who coached both Payton Manning and Eli Manning
</p>
      <p>
  After the pick, the NFL world had a good time mocking the Giants.

  Of course, the draft is a crapshoot, and the team, coaching
  staff, and setup has as much to do with that player's success as
  the actual player.
</p>
      <p>
  But in an offseason where the Giants have traded away Odell
  Beckham Jr., let Landon Collins walk, and committed to Manning
  again, they didn't win over many skeptics with an outside-the-box
  pick.

      <p>
  Ohio State edge rusher Nick Bosa's social-media use has drawn
  criticism in the lead-up to the NFL draft.
</p>
      <p>
  Bosa, who was taken with the second overall pick by the San
  Francisco 49ers on Thursday, has tweeted support for President
  Donald Trump and followed and liked conservative and right-wing
  accounts on social media.
</p>
      <p>
  In addition, Bosa called Colin Kaepernick a "clown" in a tweet,
  criticized Beyoncé's music, and called "Black Panther" the worst
  Marvel movie, raising eyebrows from skeptics.
</p>
      <p>
  One Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/RzstProgramming/status/1121079857142616067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1121079857142616067&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fblacksportsonline.com%2F2019%2F04%2Fmaga-nick-bosa-likes-post-about-donald-trump-calling-lebron-dumb-follows-private-white-nationalist-ig-acct-filled-with-racial-homophobic-islamophobic-posts-deleted-tweets-ig%2F3%2F">
  outlined incidents in which Bosa liked Instagram posts</a> from
  an account called "too_savage_for_democrats," which included
  posts about funding for Trump's border wall.
</p>
      <p>
  Bosa has since deleted many of his tweets. He <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2019/story/_/id/26470980/nick-bosa-nfl-draft-best-prospect-itching-return-field">
  told ESPN's Keith Van Valkenburg</a> that he needed to before the
  draft because of where he could land.
</p>
      <p>
  "I had to," Bosa said. "There is a chance I might end up in San
  Francisco."
</p>
      <p>
  Still, some have been critical of Bosa remaining a top draft
  prospect.

  <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2019/04/23/opinion-real-problem-nick-bosas-political-tweets/3554841002/">
  USA Today's Nancy Armour wrote</a> that deleting the tweets was
  as much of a problem for Bosa as the tweets themselves:
</p>
      <p>
  "Our personal beliefs are just that, personal, and Bosa is
  entitled to his. But as a star athlete, he also has a platform.
  And with it comes a responsibility to be both authentic and
  informed, as well as an obligation to own his actions, decisions
  and, yes, his opinions."
</p>
      <p>
  Bosa is far from the first NFL player to have shown support Trump
  or have right-leaning opinions.
</p>
      <p>
  ESPN's draft guru Todd McShay <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/sports/nick-bosa-twitter-nfl-draft.html">
  told The New York Times' Marc Tracy</a> that Bosa's social-media
  posts and political beliefs wouldn't affect his draft stock:
</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc228ddfa99af77ed520eda-1536-1151.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <cite>Jamie Sabau/Getty Images</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  "I can't imagine a team sitting in a
  draft room - and I've asked teams - saying, 'We're going to pass
  on this guy because he's left or right wing.' ... As long as it's
  not something that from a character standpoint is something that
  is concerning or alarming, I don't think politics will play into
  where a guy gets picked."
</p>
      <p>
  Similarly, <a href="https://theathletic.com/939739/2019/04/23/kawakami-the-49ers-bosa-and-raiders-whoever-falls-to-no-4-dont-need-to-get-cute-with-their-top-picks/">
  The Athletic's Tim Kawakami wrote</a> that locker rooms are
  tolerant of opposing political views, as long as players work
  hard and treat others well:
</p>
      <p>
  "I know a lot of players with very different political beliefs
  who bonded quite successfully when they were put together to win
  games ... Generally, if the locker room believes you are genuine,
  you care for your teammates, you work hard, you help the team win
  and you're not obnoxious, why wouldn't you be embraced? Why
  wouldn't Bosa be embraced if he plays well, works hard and isn't
  obnoxious?"
</p>
      <p>
  Bosa's social-media use obviously did not affect his standing in
  the draft. His past, present, and future social-media activity
  still figures to be monitored, however.

  The Democratic Party is cracking down on candidates who hope to

  Republicans were quick to call out Ocasio-Cortez for her mistake.

      <p>
  "We have a message for the woke socialist from New York. This
  older male member is a Democrat," The National Republican
  Campaign Committee <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2019/04/25/quick-intro/">wrote in a

  committee. This budget committee member is the chairman. This

  The Arizona Cardinals selected Kyler Murray with the first
  overall pick of the NFL draft on Thursday night.
</p>
      <p>
  The move was widely expected in the weeks leading up to the
  draft, but had come into question in the final hours as rumors of
  a potential wild card deal began to spread through the NFL world.

  mystery, and it could lead to chaos</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  They were all for naught. First year Cardinals head coach
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kyler-murray-nfl-draft-top-pick-kliff-kingsbury-cardinals-i2019-1">Kliff Kingsbury had said while he
  was still coaching at Texas Tech</a> that if he had the first
  overall pick in the draft, he would take Murray. On Thursday, he
  made good on his word.
</p>
      <p>
  With the Cardinals selecting Murray, it leaves them with another
  deal to make - trading away second-year quarterback Josh Rosen,
  whom Arizona traded up for in the draft last year.
</p>
      <p>
  While Rosen is still a young prospect, moving him might be harder
  than initially imagined, as interest in the former UCLA
  quarterback has reportedly not been overwhelming.

</p>
      <p>
  For now, the Arizona Cardinals have two young quarterbacks, but
  moving forward, there's little doubt that Murray will be the face
  of the franchise.

    <strong>Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis testified he did
    not observe acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, a former
    Boeing executive, breaching ethical boundaries while he was in
    charge at the US Defense Department, according to a report from
    the Pentagon's inspector general released on Thursday.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>One of the allegations against Shanahan said he
    "repeatedly dumped" on Lockheed Martin's F-35 and described it
    as "f---ed up."</strong> <strong>Military officials suggested
    Shanahan's comments referred to the F-35 program and not the
    aircraft itself.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mattis agreed that Shanahan's scrutiny of the cost of
    the F-35 was justified: "Secretary Shanahan would have been
    derelict in his duties if he didn't point that out bluntly and
    carry out his responsibilities for the tax dollars that we were
    spending," Mattis told investigators.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>"I didn't pay him to be a shrinking violet when it came
    to saving the Government money," Mattis said.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The inspector general's report</strong> <strong>stems
    from an internal investigation examining whether Shanahan
    improperly touted his former employer while disparaging its
    competitors. He was cleared of any wrongdoing in that
    matter.</strong>

  Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis testified he did not observe
  acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing
  executive, breaching ethical boundaries while he was in charge at
  the US Defense Department, according to a report from the
  Pentagon's inspector general released on Thursday.
</p>
      <p>
  Shanahan was the subject of an inspector general investigation
  following numerous allegations that he violated ethics rules by
  taking "actions to promote his former employer, Boeing, and
  disparage its competitors." <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pentagon-clears-acting-pentagon-head-accused-of-aiding-boeing-source-2019-4">
  Shanahan was cleared of any wrongdoing in that matter</a>,
  according to the inspector general's report released on Thursday.
</p>
      <p>
  Mattis denied hearing Shanahan, the deputy Defense Secretary at
  the time, make crude remarks about Boeing's competitors or
  advocate for contracts for his former employer. Companies like
  Lockheed Martin, the contractor for the US's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-pentagons-newest-assessment-of-the-f-35-is-in-and-its-not-good-2019-1">
  F-35</a> Joint Strike Fighter program, often compete for
  lucrative contracts that cost billions of dollars.
</p>
      <p>
  "We look with more than a spectator's view at [the F-35 program],
  in other words we're looking at it as an owner of the airplane,
  yeah maybe he said something like that but he's doing his job as
  far as I'm concerned," Mattis said, according to the inspector
  general's report. "I didn't pay him to be a shrinking violet when
  it came to saving the Government money."
</p>
      <p>
  Mattis, who resigned in 2018, said he saw Shanahan as an "ethical
  standard bearer ... on a whole host of issues," and that he
  "always saw him as part of my solution."

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  Shanahan was also accused of disparaging Lockheed Martin and its
  CEO, Marillyn Hewson. According to one claim, Shanahan
  "repeatedly dumped" on the F-35 and described it as "f---ed up."
</p>
      <p>
  A Navy admiral who heard the comment said Shanahan criticized the
  cost and timeliness of the F-35 program, and not the aircraft
  itself.
</p>
      <p>
  Mattis agreed with the "justifiably critical" assessment:
  "Secretary Shanahan would have been derelict in his duties if he
  didn't point that out bluntly and carry out his responsibilities
  for the tax dollars that we were spending," Mattis said.
</p>
      <p>
  On allegations that Shanahan pressured US Marine Corps commandant
  Gen. Robert Neller to purchase Boeing F/A 18s, a previous
  generation of aircraft, Neller testified it never happened.
</p>
      <p>
  According to the allegation, Neller was said to have taken the
  issue to Mattis, who intervened on his behalf. Neller; however,
  shot down the notion: "Nobody gets [Secretary] Mattis to do
  anything," Neller told investigators.
</p>
      <p>
  Other senior defense officials agreed that Shanahan complied with
  ethics agreements and walked away from conversations concerning
  Boeing.
</p>
      <p>
  When topics regarding the Boeing KC-46, a military refueling
  aircraft, were discussed, Shanahan interjected and said, "We have
  to stop the conversation," according to Air Force chief of staff
  Gen. David Goldfein.
</p>
      <p>
  In another conversation about a Boeing program in 2017, Shanahan
  cut it short: "Stop. That's a Boeing program. I can't talk about
  it," US Strategic Command's Air Force Gen. John Hyten recalled
  Shanahan as saying.
</p>
      <p>
  "Not even conceptually about future capabilities?," Hyten asked
  at the time.
</p>
      <p>
  "No, I can't talk about that at all," Shanahan replied.
</p>
      <p>
  Shanahan became the acting Defense Secretary in January 2019,
  shortly after Mattis' resignation in late December.

      <ul>
  <li>Amazon has been the subject of a lot of condemnation of late,
  from groups including politicians, software developers,
  environmentalists, and more. 
  </li>
  <li>So in its quarterly financial report, Amazon fought back and
  showcased a list of worthy projects with a social impact that it
  launched last quarter.
  </li>
  <li>The message appears clear: It wants people to feel good about
  spending so much money with the company, which on Thursday
  announced that it did $59.7 billion in revenue in the last
  quarter. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">Visit
    Business Insider's homepage for more stories.</a>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  Wall Street had expected a lot from Amazon's Q1 2019 earnings
  report, and Amazon delivered. It met lofty revenue expectations,
  smashed its profit numbers, and posted double-digit growth across
  <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190425005943/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Quarter-Sales-17-59.7-Billion">
  most of its business units</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  And yet, in the financial press release, did CEO Jeff Bezos tout
  a particular great selling product? A business strategy? Give a
  flowers quote praising his team for "execution?" Nope.
</p>
      <p>
  Here's what Bezos talked about in the <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-first-quarter-sales-17-597-billion">
  earnings press release</a>: 
</p>
      <p>
  "The son of a working single mom, Leo Jean Baptiste grew up
  speaking Haitian Creole in a New Jersey home without internet
  access. He's also one of our inaugural group of 100 high school
  seniors to receive a $40,000 Amazon Future Engineer scholarship
  and Amazon internship."
</p>
      <p>
  Bezos went on to explain that Amazon's "passion for
  invention led us to create Amazon Future Engineer so we could
  help young people like Leo from underrepresented groups and
  underserved communities across the country."
</p>
      <p>
  This student is one of 100 who was awarded a scholarship - part
  of a bigger program <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-future-engineer-brings-computer-science-courses-more-1000">
  with a $50 million budget</a> -that funds computer science
  classes in 1,000 high schools, and that runs coding camps and
  after-school programs for kids.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>Read</strong><em><strong>: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-system-automatically-fires-warehouse-workers-time-off-task-2019-4">
  Amazon's warehouse-worker tracking system can automatically fire
  people without a human supervisor's involvement</a></strong></em>
</p>
      <p>
  And then Amazon went on in the quarterly release to discuss:
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>"Shipment Zero," a new goal to make customers shipments
  carbon neutral by 2030;
  </li>
  <li>Three new renewable energy projects for Amazon Web Services,
  its massively profitable cloud platform;
  </li>
  <li>A new $10 million commitment for research grants with the
  National Science Foundation focused on "fairness in Artificial
  Intelligence (AI);"
  </li>
  <li>An award this quarter by LinkedIn naming it a desirable
  company to work for;
  </li>
  <li>The release of Open Distro for Elasticsearch, one of
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-web-services-open-source-elasticsearch-2019-3">
    Amazon's biggest open-source initiatives to date</a>. 
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  In comparison, in previous quarters Bezos <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-fourth-quarter-sales-20-724-billion">
  praised</a> the growth of <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-third-quarter-sales-29-566-billion">
  Alexa</a>, or <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-first-quarter-sales-43-510-billion">
  Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>, or some lesser-known success
  stories, like <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-third-quarter-sales-29-566-billion">
  Amazon Business.</a> Last quarter, at least, the company
  made no mention of its carbon footprint.

  jerks' culture</a></strong></em>
</p>
      <h2>
  Why the emphasis on social do-good in the last quarter?
</h2>
      <p>
  Note that this is the first quarterly report after Amazon's New
  York HQ2 disaster, where the company pulled out of the agreement
  after facing protests, condemnation and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/nyregion/newyorktoday/AOC-Amazon-nyc.html">
  some static from elected officials.</a>

          <cite>Getty</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  Its
  critics didn't feel like Amazon was deserving of the tax breaks
  the city had offered - to that point, Amazon paid no federal
  taxes two years in a row, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-not-paying-taxes-trump-bezos-2018-4">
  a tax watchdog group reports</a>. 
</p>
      <p>
  But there's probably more going on than just a gesture at New
  York. It's a gesture at Amazon critics all over over the place.
</p>
      <p>
  Amazon is a controversial company. It's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-changes-prime-shipping-one-day-2019-4">
  fantastic for its customers</a>, has a mixed reputation for
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-system-automatically-fires-warehouse-workers-time-off-task-2019-4">
  how it treats its employees</a>, and has an even murkier
  reputation <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-amazon-netflix-its-a-disgrace-companies-do-not-pay-taxes/">
  over its role as a corporate citizen</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  For instance, in the past quarter:
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>Greenpeace accused the company <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/greenpeace-finds-amazon-breaking-commitment-to-power-cloud-with-100-renewable-energy/">
    of breaking its clean energy commitments</a>. So in this
    report, Amazon delved into its ecological projects.
  </li>
  <li>AI researchers demanded Amazon stop selling its facial
  recognition to law enforcement after the ACLU raised concerns
  about the tech. So in this report, Amazon discussed its grants to
  make the tech better.
  </li>
  <li>The release of that same Open Distro for Elasticsearch caused
  controversy - while Amazon says that it did it in service to
  users, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-web-services-elastic-elasticsearch-2019-3">
    original developer of Elasticsearch took the retailer to task
    over the project</a>, playing into Amazon Web Services' larger
    reputation as being a poor partner to open source software.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  This was the quarter that the company seemed to realize: low
  prices, free shipping and great technology may be enough to make
  Wall Street happy. But people want to feel good about where they
  spend their money, too.

  Lara Trump, President Donald Trump's daughter-in-law and an
  official on his campaign, said German Chancellor Angela Merkel's
  2015 decision to open the country's doors to Middle Eastern
  refugees "led to the downfall of Germany."
</p>
      <p>
  "It was one of the worst things to ever happen to Germany," Trump
  said during a Fox Business interview on Thursday. "This president
  knows that. He's trying to prevent that from happening here. But
  Congress has got to get their act together and do the right thing
  for the American people."
</p>
      <p>
  Trump, who is married to the president's son Eric, made her
  comments after the Fox host Stuart Varney said that a caravan of
  Central American migrants reminded him of the millions of
  refugees who made perilous journeys to Europe in 2015.
</p>
      <p>
  Trump made no mention of Nazism, Adolf Hitler, or the Holocaust -
  something that <a href="https://twitter.com/MollyJongFast/status/1121477780397547521">critics</a>
  online <a href="https://twitter.com/Eugene_Scott/status/1121448417396445184">slammed</a>
  her and Fox for.
</p>
      <p>
  Merkel allowed more than 1 million refugees into Germany in 2015
  during a migrant crisis spurred by violent conflicts in Syria,
  Afghanistan, and Iraq.
</p>
      <p>
  The president has repeatedly slammed the German leader's decision
  and has accused her of "ruining" Germany as a result. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/world/europe/fact-check-trump-germany.html">
  falsely claimed</a> last year that crime in Germany was "way up"
  as a result of migration. While overall crime fell by 9% in
  Germany in 2017, a 25-year low, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/world/europe/immigration-germany-merkel.html">
  violent crime rose by 10%</a> in 2015 and 2016.
</p>
      <p>
  Germany's domestic debate over immigration policy has also helped
  fuel the rise of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/world/europe/alternative-for-germany-investigation.html">
  right-wing nationalism</a> and a political party, Alternative for
  Germany, that has been tied to and cheered by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/world/europe/germany-neo-nazi-protests-chemnitz.html?module=inline">
  some neo-Nazis</a>.

  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/davos-top-psychedelic-scientist-mdma-magic-mushrooms-medicine-2019-1">
    psychedelics</a> opens on Friday with backing from author and
    entrepreneur Tim Ferriss.
  </li>
  <li>Located in London, the new center will be ground zero for
  studying the potential of turning drugs like ecstasy and
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/psychedelics-depression-anxiety-alcoholism-mental-illness-2017-1">
    magic mushrooms</a> into medical treatments.
  </li>
  <li>It's called the Imperial Center for Psychedelic Research, and
  it was funded with nearly $4 million from donors.
  </li>
  <li>Scientists at the center will focus on using psychedelics to
  treat thorny brain diseases like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/psychedelics-depression-anxiety-alcoholism-mental-illness-2017-1">
    depression</a>, anxiety, and anorexia.

      <p>
  One podcast episode was all it took to hook the best-selling
  author and investor Tim Ferriss on the topic of psychedelics.
</p>
      <p>
  For one of his recent shows, Ferriss interviewed author Michael
  Pollan about his <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-pollan-on-trying-lsd-mushrooms-2018-5">
  latest book</a>, "How to Change Your Mind," which details
  Pollan's experiences trying several <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/psychedelics-depression-anxiety-alcoholism-mental-illness-2017-1">
  psychedelic drugs</a> including magic mushrooms and LSD. After
  talking through Pollan's trips and diving into the science of how
  the drugs appear to impact the brain, Ferriss' interest was
  piqued.
</p>
      <p>
  On Friday, with Ferriss' financial backing, researchers will open
  the doors to the world's first research hub dedicated exclusively
  to psychedelics.
</p>
      <p>
  Located in London, the Imperial Center for Psychedelic Research
  will be home to scientists studying the potential to turn drugs
  like ecstasy, magic mushrooms, and LSD into approved medical
  treatments. Scientists will focus on addressing severe brain
  diseases which remain difficult to treat, such as depression and
  the eating disorder anorexia.
</p>
      <p>
  "Current treatments aren't cutting it. They're not making the
  difference we need," Robin Carhart-Harris, the head of the new
  center and a neuroscience and pharmacology researcher at London's
  Imperial College, told Business Insider.
</p>
      <p>
  The center's other funders include Canadian businessperson and
  founder of audiobooks.com Sanjay Singhal,
  banker-turned-philanthropist and Google advisor Shamil Chandaria,
  British executive Anton Bilton, and venture capitalist Bohdana
  Tamas.
</p>
      <p>
  While psychedelics like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meditation-ayahuasca-change-brain-similar-2017-4">
  ayahuasca</a> have played a medical and spiritual role in
  indigenous cultures across the globe for centuries, the new
  center will be the first formal hub of its kind.
</p>
      <p>
  "These compounds may help treat intractable conditions affecting
  tens of millions of people, and they may help us better
  understand the nature of consciousness itself," Ferris said in a
  statement.
</p>
      <h2>
  A flurry of renewed interest in psychedelics as medicine

      <p>
  The center's opening comes on
  the heels of a flurry of renewed interest in psychedelics'
  potential to treat thorny brain diseases like depression.
</p>
      <p>
  Up until last month, there had been essentially only one kind of
  federally-approved antidepressant for decades. That drug is a
  pill called an SSRI. It is commonly sold under brand names like
  Lexapro and Prozac. But in March, the US Food and Drug
  Administration <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/esketamine-depression-drug-approved-fda-johnson-johnson-antidepressant-2019-2">
  approved</a> the first new non-SSRI depression drug: a nasal
  spray inspired by the semi-psychedelic drug ketamine.
</p>
      <p>
  "Things have really started to gain momentum," Carhart-Harris
  said.
</p>
      <p>
  With nearly $4 million from its five founding donors, the
  center's researchers also aim to open a clinic. Ideally, the
  clinic would function as a prototype for future psychedelic
  medical facilities. Carhart-Harris said he hopes the space could
  serve simultaneously as a clinic for treating illness and also
  for helping to keep healthy people well.
</p>
      <h2>
  Scientists will build on a foundation of pioneering work on drugs
  like magic mushrooms and LSD
</h2>
      <p>
  In Carhart-Harris' view, the new center will help build on a
  foundation of pioneering efforts into studying psychedelics'
  medical potential.
</p>
      <p>
  Under his leadership, scientists at Imperial College were the
  first to study whether <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/psychedelics-depression-anxiety-alcoholism-mental-illness-2017-1">
  psilocybin</a>, the main psychoactive component of magic
  mushrooms, had a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/psychedelics-depression-anxiety-alcoholism-mental-illness-2017-1">
  positive impact</a> on patients with severe depression. They were
  also global leaders in exploring the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microdosing-lsd-effects-risks-science-2017-5">
  impacts of LSD</a> on the human brain using modern brain-imaging
  technology.
</p>
      <p>
  Based on that work, researchers in New York and Baltimore
  launched their own clinical trials designed to further probe the
  drugs' therapeutic potential. They've now studied psilocybin in
  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/psychedelics-depression-anxiety-alcoholism-mental-illness-2017-1">
  cancer patients</a> facing severe anxiety about death; ecstasy in
  veterans with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-promising-uses-psychedelic-drugs-medicine-science-2018-10">
  PTSD</a>; and ayahuasca in people with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/psychedelics-trip-therapy-2018-1">
  depression</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fda-approves-new-depression-drug-brexanalone-zulresso-post-partum-sage-2018-12">
  Regulators just approved a new depression drug with the potential
  to be a game-changer</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Still, psychedelic researchers have faced roadblocks along the
  way, Carhart-Harris said.
</p>
      <p>
  Part of the motivation for the new center came from frustration
  with repeated attempts to raise funds from mainstream medical
  groups like the National Institutes of Health and the UK's
  National Health Service.
</p>
      <p>
  "We've faced the perfect storm of stigma," Carhart-Harris said.
  "Psychedelics are scary to some people, and then mental illness,
  that can be a sensitive topic. Even psychotherapy and psychology
  are also heavily stigmatized."
</p>
      <p>
  Earlier this year, Carhart-Harris' group started a new trial in
  people with depression that will compare psilocybin with a
  traditional antidepressant. Next year, they aim to assess whether
  the same drug could also hold potential to treat anorexia. Both
  diseases seem to be characterized by a kind of rigidity, he said.
  Whether they are about self-doubt or food, cyclical and pervasive
  thoughts trap the brain in a whirlwind of negativity.
</p>
      <p>
  "Psychedelics seem to relax these biases of thought and behavior
  so you get a kind of openness," Carhart-Harris said.
</p>
      <p>
  "That's a window of opportunity for therapy where if you can
  cultivate healthy changes, potentially you're on a good track."

    The former TPG executive Bill McGlashan was charged as
    part of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin-charged-college-admissions-scandal-2019-3">wide-ranging
    college-admissions scandal</a> last month. Following his
    indictment, the private equity firm said fired him. He said he
    quit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now, TPG has stripped McGlashan of his fund stakes, which
    are likely worth millions.
  </li>
  <li>
    An internal memo seen by Business Insider described a
    firm-wide investigation that revealed two other employees who
    had been in contact with the college admissions consultant at
    the center of the scandal, both for legitimate college
    counseling.

  Bill McGlashan was stripped of his job <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/caught-in-college-admissions-scandal-mcglashan-asks-for-passport-2019-3">
  and his passport</a> after being indicted in the wide-ranging
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-mcglashan-is-fired-from-tpg-2019-3">
  college admissions scandal last month</a>. 
</p>
      <p>
  Now, the former TPG executive has lost his fund stakes, which are
  likely worth millions, <a href="https://www.axios.com/bill-mcglashan-college-bribery-penalty-tpg-07c2e023-a23f-49f2-ba24-835ca046d0e6.html">
  </a>after an internal investigation, which was detailed in a memo
  seen by Business Insider.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more:</strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tpg-and-bono-launch-y-analytics-for-impact-investing-2019-1">
  Private-equity giant TPG is launching a new company that
  measures the social impact of a $228 billion investing
  market</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  <a href="https://www.axios.com/bill-mcglashan-college-bribery-penalty-tpg-07c2e023-a23f-49f2-ba24-835ca046d0e6.html">
  Per Axios,</a> McGlashan lost his stakes in four private equity
  funds and the first TPG impact investing fund. A TPG spokesperson
  said he will keep his unvested stake in the firm itself and that
  TPG is unable to take back other interests, such as money that's
  invested alongside the private equity funds.
</p>
      <p>
  "We believe this to be an appropriate response according to
  our standards, the trusted relationship we have with our
  investors and the harm incurred," the TPG representative said in
  a statement. "The economics recaptured from Mr. McGlashan will
  primarily be reinvested back into the business to recruit, retain
  and strengthen the team."
</p>
      <p>
  The fallout is likely to take months or years to unwind, as
  McGlashan's last spokesperson earlier said he plans to fight the
  charges.
</p>
      <p>
  McGlashan's new spokesman could not immediately be reached for
  comment. 
</p>
      <p>
  McGlashan, who joined the firm in 2004, is the founder and
  managing partner of TPG Growth, which makes investments in growth
  equity and middle-market buyouts. He's also cofounder and CEO of
  the Rise Fund, an investment fund focused on companies trying to
  tackle social and environmental issues.
</p>
      <p>
  McGlashan was among dozens of parents and coaches
  <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/arrests-made-nationwide-college-admissions-scam-alleged-exam-cheating-athletic">indicted by the FBI</a>
  in an alleged scheme, masterminded by consultant Rick
  Singer, to get students into elite colleges. He was charged first
  with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services
  mail fraud, then later with money laundering. 
</p>
      <p>
  Within two days after the scandal broke, TPG fired McGlashan -
  though <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-mcglashan-is-fired-from-tpg-2019-3">
  he said he quit</a> - and hired top law firm Ropes &amp; Gray and
  accounting firm EY to conduct a "thorough" investigation, per a
  statement from a TPG representative.
</p>
      <p>
  They did not find any evidence that other employees were
  "implicated in or aware of the conduct alleged in the charges
  against Mr. McGlashan," according to the statement. "Furthermore,
  the investigation found no evidence that fund or Firm monies were
  paid to Mr. Singer or his related entities, and no fraud or
  systematic misconduct associated with Mr. McGlashan's financial
  dealings with the funds or Firm." 
</p>
      <p>
  According to an employee memo on Thursday seen by Business
  Insider, the investigation found that: 
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>One employee talked with but did not employ Singer, and two
  subsequently worked with him for legitimate college consulting.
  </li>
  <li>In March 2017, McGlashan had introduced members of the firm's
  private equity fund and its impact fund to Singer for potential
  investments. The teams decided against investing and had limited
  contact with Singer afterwards.
  </li>
  <li>While the firm didn't find any evidence of fraud, when they
  looked at McGlashan's company finances, they uncovered six
  expenses totaling nearly $25,000 that were either charged
  incorrectly to the funds or didn't have the right documentation.
  TPG is refunding the money to those funds. 
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>

  Street Insider, a behind-the-scenes look at the stories

</p>
      <p>
  McGlashan has been accused of donating $50,000 to a
  nonprofit "with the understanding" that the <a href="https://www.insider.com/william-rick-singer-the-accused-ringleader-college-admissions-scandal-2019-3">college
  consultant Singer</a> would arrange for someone to
  administer and then correct his son's ACT at a West Hollywood,
  California, testing center that Singer "controlled," according to
  the indictment. His 18-year old son, who, according to the
  indictment, did not know about the scheme, submitted his ACT
  score of 34 to Northeastern University in October. His son has
  withdrawn his college applications, according to the
  filing.
</p>
      <p>
  At a conference last month, TPG co-CEO Jon Winkelried said the
  original news was "pretty shocking."
</p>
      <p>
  "Any time something like this happens, it sort of takes your
  breath away for a minute," he said. Investors "naturally have a
  lot of questions. We've undertaken an investigation internally to
  make sure that none of the things Bill was engaged in were
  bleeding into the business."
</p>
      <p>
  TPG has more than $100 billion in assets, with the growth fund
  holding $13.2 billion in assets, <a href="http://tpg.com/platforms/tpggrowth">according to the company's
  website</a>.

      <p>
  Embattled MoviePass competitor Sinemia has shut down its US
  operations, the company said in a statement posted to its website
  on Thursday. The abrupt closure came right before "Avengers:
  Endgame," <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/avengers-endgame-has-biggest-china-box-office-opening-of-all-time-2019-4">
  which is already breaking box-office records,</a> opens in
  theaters.
</p>
      <p>
  "We are all witnessing that the future of moviegoing is evolving
  through movie ticket subscriptions," the movie-ticket
  subscription service said in the statement. "However, we didn't
  see a path to sustainability as an independent movie ticket
  subscription service in the face of competition from movie
  theaters as they build their own subscriptions."
</p>
      <p>
  The company's announcement did not address whether customers who
  paid for yearly plans up front would get partial refunds.
</p>
      <p>
  Sinemia said that its "efforts to cover the cost of unexpected
  legal proceedings and raise the funds required to continue
  operations have not been sufficient."
</p>
      <p>
  Some customers filed a class-action lawsuit in
  November, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/class-action-lawsuit-against-moviepass-competitor-sinemia-heating-up-2019-3">
  which was amended in late February</a>, alleging Sinemia
  ripped them off by introducing a new "processing fee." MoviePass
  had also filed a <a href="https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/moviepass-sinemia-patent-lawsuit-dismiss-1203182214/">
  patent infringement lawsuit against Sinemia</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  Sinemia said in March that it had terminated "approximately 3
  percent of its accounts due to misuse or fraudulent activity."
  But more than 100 users contacted Business Insider saying their
  accounts were terminated unfairly. One user even went so far as
  to document on video, and post on YouTube, the
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/video-shows-moviepass-competitor-sinemia-terminating-a-users-account-2019-3">process
  of getting his account canceled</a> while trying to
  buy a "Captain Marvel" ticket. Sinemia had promised to offer
  terminated users partial refunds of the difference between what
  they had paid into their Sinemia plan versus what Sinemia had
  paid movie theaters.
</p>
      <p>
  Sinemia was started in Turkey in 2014 and also operates in
  countries including Canada, Australia, and the UK. It's
  unclear how operations in those countries will be
  affected.
</p>
      <p>
  MoviePass has faced its own financial challenges. After burning
  hundreds of millions of dollars, the company was forced to alter
  its features to stay in business, prompting its subscriber count
  to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/moviepass-down-from-3-million-subscribers-to-225000-users-data-2019-4">
  drop from over 3 million to around 225,000</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>Here is the full statement from Sinemia posted on
  Thursday:</strong>
</p>
      <p>
  Dear Customer, 
</p>
      <p>
  Today, with a heavy heart, we're announcing that Sinemia is
  closing its doors and ending operations in the US effective
  immediately. 
</p>
      <p>
  As Sinemia, we set out our journey with the vision to help as
  many moviegoers as possible to enjoy an affordable and better
  experience at the movies by a creating a movie ticket
  subscription service that adds value for both the moviegoers and
  the movie industry. Since 2014, we've been fine-tuning our model
  and serving movie-goers with a slate of affordable and flexible
  subscription plans. 
</p>
      <p>
  We are all witnessing that the future of moviegoing is evolving
  through movie ticket subscriptions. However, we didn't see a path
  to sustainability as an independent movie ticket subscription
  service in the face of competition from movie theaters as they
  build their own subscriptions. Thanks to the cost advantage and
  cross-sell opportunities, movie theaters will be prominent in the
  movie ticket subscription economy. 
</p>
      <p>
  While we are proud to have created a best in market service, our
  efforts to cover the cost of unexpected legal proceedings and
  raise the funds required to continue operations have not been
  sufficient. The competition in the US market and the core
  economics of what it costs to deliver Sinemia's end-to-end
  experience ultimately lead us to the decision of discontinuing
  our US operations. 
</p>
      <p>
  Despite the best efforts of our team, it has been difficult for
  us as a start-up to continue providing our services to the
  moviegoers in the US without resources and enough capital to meet
  increased operations and legal costs. 
</p>
      <p>
  We want to sincerely thank our customers that believed in us and
  helped us along the way for their love and support. 
</p>
      <p>
  We are so grateful to have had the opportunity to share our dream
  with you.

  Sen. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bernie-sanders-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">
  Bernie Sanders</a> has faced pushback from many Republicans and
  caused <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-2020-democrats-divided-on-felon-prisoner-voting-rights-2019-4">
  division among 2020 Democrats</a> for saying all prisoners in the
  US - no matter how <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-calls-voting-rights-prisoners-2019-4">
  "terrible" their crimes</a> - should be allowed to vote while
  serving their sentence. 
</p>
      <p>
  But many other countries, including key US allies, already
  enfranchise current inmates on some level.

  South Africa</a> are <a href="https://felonvoting.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000289">
  among over a dozen countries</a> that allow prisoners to vote in
  elections.
</p>
      <p>
  There are 26 European nations that partially enfranchise
  currently incarcerated people, while 18 countries grant prisoners
  voting rights regardless of offense, according to <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/projects/prisoner-voting/">a
  May 2018</a> report from People's Policy Project.

  <em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-2020-democrats-divided-on-felon-prisoner-voting-rights-2019-4">
  Bernie Sanders' call for all prisoners to be able to vote sets
  him apart from almost every other 2020 Democrat</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  In Germany, Norway, and Portugal, for example, the vast
  majority of prisoners are allowed to vote but those convicted of
  crimes that specifically target the "integrity of the state" or
  "constitutionally protected democratic order" are
  disenfranchised. Meanwhile, Iceland bans voting for those who've
  been sentenced to <a href="https://www.government.is/publications/legislation/lex/?newsid=027e6a1a-f46b-11e7-9423-005056bc530c">
  at least four years in prison.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  The European Court of Human Rights in 2005 declared that
  blanket bans on prisoners voting violate human rights laws, which
  after a lengthy court battle led the UK in late 2017 to change
  its laws to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/07/council-of-europe-accepts-uk-compromise-on-prisoner-voting-rights">
  enfranchise a small number of prisoners.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  Sanders has responded to his critics on this issue by
  referencing the fact many countries around the world enfranchise
  voters.
</p>
      <p>
  "More than 30 countries around the world today such as Canada,
  South Africa and Finland allow prisoners to vote," Sanders
  <a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1121127964811329536">said
  in a tweet</a> on Wednesday. "This is not a radical idea. Every
  American citizen must be able to vote. Period."
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism-soviet-union-authoritarian-communism-2019-4">
  Bernie Sanders says his idea of democratic socialism isn't like
  the 'authoritarian communism' of the Soviet Union</a></em> 
</p>
      <p>
  Allowing prisoners to vote is also the status quo in two US
  states - Vermont and Maine - and the US territory of Puerto Rico.
  Meanwhile, there are movements in <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2018/02/nj_lawmakers_want_to_give_inmates_the_right_to_vot.html">
  states like New Jersey</a> for lawmakers to enfranchise
  prisoners. 
</p>
      <p>
  At present, roughly 4.5 million people in the US are affected by
  felony disenfranchisement laws. The number was closer to six
  million not long ago, but the passage of Amendment 4 in Florida
  last November helped change that by restoring voting rights to
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-florida-passes-amendment-to-restore-felons-voting-rights-2018-11">
  1.4 million people</a> with felony records. 
</p>
      <p>
  There are roughly 7,100 people locked up in various ways in
  <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/VT.html">Vermont</a> and
  <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/ME.html">Maine,</a>
  meaning far fewer than 10,000 prisoners across the 50 states have
  the right to vote. In total, there are roughly <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2019.html">2.3 million
  people</a> behind bars in the US.

  <li>Law professor Anita Hill told The New York Times that former

  testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 was
  insufficient.

    "I cannot be satisfied by simply saying I'm sorry for

    real change and real accountability and real purpose," Hill

    Biden, who announced a presidential campaign on Thursday,
    has been criticized for decades over the personal attacks Hill
    experienced while testifying. Biden chaired the committee at
    the time.

  <li>
    Biden was also criticized for declining to call multiple
    witnesses who had volunteered to testify in support of Hill's

  of Clarence Thomas, who became Justice Thomas, after being
  confirmed by the Senate to the Supreme Court.
</p>
      <p>
  Biden's deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told The
  Times that Biden "shared with her directly his regret for what
  she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to
  change the culture around sexual harassment in this
  country."
</p>
      <p>
  But she said his efforts fell short of a true apology, and
  she "left the conversation feeling deeply unsatisfied."
</p>
      <p>
  "I cannot be satisfied by simply saying I'm sorry for what
  happened to you," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-hill.html">Hill told the Times.</a> "I will
  be satisfied when I know there is real change and real
  accountability and real purpose."
</p>
      <p>
  She added that Biden "needs to give an apology to the other
  women and to the American public because we know now how deeply
  disappointed Americans around the country were about what they
  saw."

  Hill accused Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual
  misconduct, and how it compares to now</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Seven women have recently recounted instances where they
  felt Biden had made unwanted physical contact or invaded their
  personal space.
</p>
      <p>
  His campaign will have to contend with accusations
  that he not only made women feel uncomfortable but failed to
  stand up for Hill when it mattered the most.
</p>
      <p>
  Biden has been criticized for declining to call multiple
  witnesses who had volunteered to testify in support of Hill's
  account of Thomas' alleged harassment as part of a deal with
  Republican leadership - after Biden himself called her to testify
  in the first place. 
</p>
      <p>
  During a private interview with the FBI, Hill accused Thomas of
  sexually harassing her and creating a hostile work environment
  over a number of years while she worked for him in the Department
  of Justice's Civil Rights division and at the Equal Opportunity
  Employment Commission in the early 1980s.
</p>
      <p>
  After the interview's contents were leaked to the press, Biden
  re-opened Thomas' confirmation hearings - and called for Hill to
  publicly testify, which she did in October 1991.
</p>
      <p>
  The Republicans on the committee pressed Hill on sexually
  explicit details of the alleged harassment and sought to
  undermine her credibility at every turn, accusing her of lying
  and even questioning whether she was suffering from delusions.
  
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-regrets-1991-anita-hill-hearings-metoo-movement-2019-3">
  Joe Biden says he regrets not getting Anita Hill 'the kind of
  hearing she deserved'</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  As the committee's leader, Biden has since been heavily
  criticized for making a deal that blocked any witnesses to help
  Hill's case from publicly testifying, and for not doing enough to
  protect Hill, a woman of color, from attacks on her character
  from an all-male, all-white panel.
</p>
      <p>
  "I wish I had been able to do more for Anita Hill," Biden
  <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/joe-biden-anita-hill">told Teen
  Vogue</a> in 2017. "I owe her an apology." And at an event more
  recently, Biden still declined to take direct responsibility for
  what Hill experienced, saying, "I wish I could have done
  something."
</p>
      <p>
  Biden officially enters the race with the most experience and
  longest political record, including working for women's rights.
</p>
      <p>
  During his time in the Senate, Biden was the lead author of the
  landmark <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/1is2many/about">Violence Against Women Act,</a> passed in
  1994, which introduced a host of new legal protections and
  federal resources to both prevent domestic violence and support
  victims. As Vice President, he spearheaded initiatives to address
  dating violence and sexual assault on college campuses, including
  <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/10/26/joe-biden-lady-gaga-team-up-again-saying-its-us-stand-up-against-sexual-assault/803625001/">the "It's On Us" campaign.</a>
</p>
      <p>
  But along with the Anita Hill hearing, he'll also likely face a
  fresh round of scrutiny over <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-joe-biden-could-lose-run-for-president-2020-2019-3">his record on other issues
  involving race and gender</a>.

  ended up searching there and found the Elfa Mesh Closet Drawer
  System <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=37353&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Felfa%2Fdrawerplanner%2Findex.htm">(from $100)</a>.
  </li>
  <li>While it's not technically a nightstand, I customized
    <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=37353&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Felfa%2Fdrawerplanner%2Findex.htm">this unit</a> so it's the
    perfect size next to my bed. It works as a nightstand, storage
    unit, and great way to maximize space in a small area.
  </li>
  <li>While it cost more than I would spend on a nightstand, it's a
  multipurpose unit I know I can make good use of for years to come
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  Being in my twenties in New York City, I know that the apartment
  I'm in now won't be mine forever. That's why, when I first moved
  in, I decided to prioritize buying pieces that are particularly
  functional, rather than ones that just look good. That fact -
  plus a small room and closet situation - prompted me to search
  for a nightstand that could serve double duty and provide some
  extra storage. My search led me to the epicenter of all things
  storage: <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=37353&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fwelcome.htm">The Container Store</a>. There, I
  designed my own <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=37353&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Felfa%2Fdrawerplanner%2Findex.htm">Elfa Mesh Closet Drawer System</a>
  and it's probably one of the smartest purchases I've made for my
  apartment.

  The Elfa Mesh Closet Drawer System
</h2>
      <p>
  <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=37353&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Felfa%2Findex.htm">Elfa</a> is exclusive to <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=37353&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fwelcome.htm">The Container Store</a>, known for
  its best-selling closet solutions that maximize space and make
  organizing easy. The Mesh Closet Drawer System is a free-standing
  storage unit with a frame made with Elfa's signature, durable,
  epoxy-bonded steel, and filled with finely-woven mesh drawers
  that can hold all sorts of products, even really little ones.
</p>
      <p>
  You can choose to purchase a <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=37353&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fs%2Felfa%2Fbest-selling-solutions%2Fdrawer-units%2Fwhite-elfa-mesh-closet-drawers%2F123d%3FproductId%3D10014851">pre-made unit</a> or customize
  your own with specific dimensions for what you're looking for.
  Whether you choose to make your own or go for the ready-made
  option, you can pick from an all-white or a classic silver mesh.
</p>
      <p>
  I chose to make my own unit to be sure it would fit in my room.
  Elfa has a <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=37353&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Felfa%2Fdrawerplanner%2Findex.htm">custom drawer planner</a> online,
  which guides you through the customization process and helps you
  see what the unit will look like in real time. <strong>Here's a
  quick overview of how you can customize the unit:</strong>
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>1. Pick a color:</strong> The options are easy, white or
  silver. The silver definitely has a more industrial look, so I
  went for white.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>2. Pick a height: <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=37353&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Felfa%2Fdrawerplanner%2Findex.htm">Options</a></strong> range from
  17.5 to 81 inches tall. The taller you go, the more storage you
  can get. I chose a 29-inch unit, which works perfectly as a
  bedside table next to my 1- inch bed frame and 10-inch mattress. 
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>3. Pick a width:</strong> Sizes start at 10 inches (extra
  narrow) and go up to 22 inches (extra wide). I went for medium at
  18 inches.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>4. Top it off:</strong> You can cover the unit with a
  surface of either white melamine, driftwood melamine, a butcher
  block, or leave the top open. I went with the white for a
  monochromatic look. 
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>5. Pick feet, labels, and stops: <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=37353&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Felfa%2Fdrawerplanner%2Findex.htm">Choose</a></strong> frame feet for
  a unit you want to stay in place, or casters (which are like
  wheels) if you want more mobility. Add stops if you want to
  ensure your drawers never fall out. I didn't buy stops, but my
  unit is pushed against a wall, and I haven't had any issues with
  drawers coming out of the frame. I didn't add label holders, but
  if you're trying to get really organized, these could be a good
  addition.
</p>
      <p>
  <strong>6. Choose your drawers:</strong> Instead of S, M, L,
  drawers are sized as 1, 2, or 3 -  indicating
  how many runners each drawer needs to fit in the unit. One is the
  shallowest drawer and 3 is the deepest. How tall you make your
  unit will determine how many drawers you can fit.
</p>
      <p>
  My 29 inch unit has 7 runners, so I filled it with one
  3-runner, one 2-runner, and two 1-runners. The 3-runner is on the
  bottom, holding bulky items like backup toiletries and cleaning
  supplies. The 2-runner is in the middle, holding similar
  products, though it fits a tad less. The top two drawers are
  1-runners, which hold paper goods and other small supplies.
  Ultimately, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=37353&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Felfa%2Fdrawerplanner%2Findex.htm">my unit</a> cost just over
  $150.
</p>
      <h2>
  Bottom Line
</h2>
      <p>
  These drawers are not cheap, but their value lies in their
  functionality. With ability to customize height, width, and
  drawer sizes, you can easily build a system that's perfect for
  your storage needs. If you have the space and aren't too
  particular, you can make it even easier and just buy one of the
  <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=37353&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.containerstore.com%2Fs%2Felfa%2Fbest-selling-solutions%2Fdrawer-units%2Fwhite-elfa-mesh-closet-drawers%2F123d%3FproductId%3D10014851">pre-made systems</a>.

  you put inside easily accessible, and the finely-woven mesh
  construction provides the perfect balance of visibility and
  privacy, so you can find your objects easily without putting
  everything on display. The neutral colors and minimal style make
  this unit a timeless piece that can fit in just about any room
  and be used for storing just about anything, making it well-worth
  the up-front expense.

      <p>
  Amazon's Prime shipping is becoming even faster.
</p>
      <p>
  Brian Olsavsky, the company's chief financial officer, announced
  on Amazon's first-quarter 2019 earnings call that it is working
  on turning its Prime two-day shipping guarantee into a one-day
  shipping offering.
</p>
      <p>
  Prime two-day shipping is good for the delivery of more than 100
  million items sold on Amazon within two days from the day the
  item is shipped for almost all the continental US. The goal is to
  eventually offer delivery within one day from the time of
  shipment for the same number of items to the same locations. 
</p>
      <p>
  Olsavsky called the move a "significant step" and said that
  Amazon will make "steady progress throughout the year" in
  implementing the change.
</p>
      <p>
  The move will happen sooner in the US, but it is a global
  initiative, Olsavsky said.
</p>
      <p>
  Amazon will need to beef up its supply chain and fulfillment
  capabilities to become more efficient and implement the change.
  The company expects to take on $800 million in additional
  expenses tied to the new initiative in the upcoming quarter.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/two-day-shipping-poised-expansion-2019-1">Amazon
  will soon lose the biggest reason to pay for Prime</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Amazon has been moving in the direction of offering more items
  with one-day shipping in more areas of the US. Olsavsky said that
  in April, Amazon added a large number of new items in new zip
  codes to its one-day shipping program.
</p>
      <p>
  He also said Amazon will be "using all the available levers we
  have right now," including Amazon Logistics and other
  package-handling partners such as UPS, to get packages to
  customers in one day.
</p>
      <p>
  Amazon still offers same-day shipping and its two-hour delivery
  service, Amazon Prime Now, as separate offerings.

  The New York attorney general's office is launching an
  investigation into Facebook for harvesting 1.5 million users'
  email contact data without their consent, after the practice was
  revealed by Business Insider last week.
</p><p>
  On Thursday, Attorney General Letitia James said she and her
  office would look into how Facebook has handled users' personal
  data. The existence of the investigation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/technology/facebook-new-york-attorney-general-investigation.html">
  was first reported by The New York Times</a>.
</p><p>
  "We're in touch with the New York State attorney general's office
  and are responding to their questions on this matter," a
  spokesperson for Facebook told Business Insider.
</p><p>
  Earlier in April, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-uploaded-1-5-million-users-email-contacts-without-permission-2019-4">
  Business Insider reported that after asking some users for their
  email account passwords when they signed up for the social
  network</a>, it would then access their email accounts without
  permission and scoop up users' contact books, using the data for
  ad-targeting purposes and to build out its web of social
  connections.
</p><p>
  This took place from May 2016 onwards, and 1.5 million users were
  affected. Facebook says it was an accident, and that it
  previously notified users it would access their contact data -
  but that a change to its systems inadvertently removed this
  warning while leaving the underlying functionality intact.
</p><p>
  <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/attorney-general-james-announces-investigation-facebook">
  In a statement, the New York Attorney General said</a>:
</p>
  <p>"It is time Facebook is held accountable for how it handles consumers' personal information. Facebook has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of respect for consumers' information while at the same time profiting from mining that data. Facebook's announcement that it harvested 1.5 million users' email address books, potentially gaining access to contact information for hundreds of millions of individual consumers without their knowledge, is the latest demonstration that Facebook does not take seriously its role in protecting our personal information."</p>
<p>"It is time Facebook is held accountable for how it handles consumers' personal information. Facebook has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of respect for consumers' information while at the same time profiting from mining that data. Facebook's announcement that it harvested 1.5 million users' email address books, potentially gaining access to contact information for hundreds of millions of individual consumers without their knowledge, is the latest demonstration that Facebook does not take seriously its role in protecting our personal information."</p><p>
  Facebook has battled through two years of scandals, from
  Cambridge Analytica's misappropriation of tens of millions of
  users' personal data to its role spreading hate speech that
  fueled genocide in Myanmar, and it is now facing mounting
  repercussions. 
</p><p>
  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is drawing close to reaching a
  settlement with the social network over privacy issues that
  Facebook expects to be a record-breaking $3 to $5 billion -
  though this didn't seem to turn away investors. And On Thursday,
  Canada also said it believed Facebook had broken the law, and
  plans to take it to court to force it to change its practices.
  The Irish Data Protection Commission, an EU data watchdog, had
  also said it is in contact with Facebook and is considering its
  next steps.
</p><p>
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/experts-facebook-law-harvesting-1-5-users-email-contacts-2019-4">
  Experts have told Business Insider that they believe Facebook's
  actions in harvesting the 1.5 million users' email contact data
  may be illegal</a> - suggesting it could violate the 2011 FTC
  consent decree, EU data privacy law GDPR, and potentially even
  the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). A Facebook spokesperson
  previously declined to comment on the legality of the company's
  actions.

  Amid mounting pressure to address its process for

  be launching a new internal portal for its employees and its temp
  and vendor workforce (known as TVCs) to report issues, such as

</p>
      <p>
  The new site - which will bring together multiple channels

  announced on Thursday</a> alongside a broader update from Google
  highlighting the steps it has taken to address workplace concerns
  after its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-walkout-staff-protest-at-sexual-misconduct-2018-11">
  November Walkout</a> - which was prompted by the company's
  handling of sexual misconduct cases involving high-powered
  executives. 
</p>
      <p>
  A Google spokesperson told Business Insider on Thursday
  that employees had said previous methods of reporting workplace
  issues were complicated and opaque. The spokesperson
  also said the company hopes that having one,
  streamlined channel will help to increase the number of incidents
  reported so that Google can investigate more concerns and take
  appropriate action. 
</p>
      <p>
  The update - which came from Google's recently appointed
  Chief Diversity Officer, Melonie Parker - also included the
  company's <a href="http://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/policy_workplace_concerns.pdf">
  13-page internal workplace policies</a>, which is the first time
  this document has been shared publicly. 
</p>
      <p>
  "A big part of my job is to listen to ideas that Googlers
  have and take feedback on ways we can improve our workplace,"
  Parker said. "We won't implement every idea that our employees
  (or the outside world) raise, but we always listen, and we
  consider constructive feedback." 
</p>
      <p>
  Google's former diversity lead, Danielle Brown, left in
  early April after a tumultuous year for employee relations at the
  tech giant, which included a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/26/google-gender-pay-gap-women-class-action-lawsuit">
  class-action lawsuit</a> by employees over pay discrimination and
  the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-walkout-17000-google-employees-protested-sexual-misconduct-2018-11">
  20,000 person walkout</a>. 
</p>
      <p>
  The workplace updates also come just days after two of the women
  who helped organize the walkout said Google had demoted them - a
  decision they considered retaliation for spearheading the
  November protests. Google denied the allegations of retaliation
  and said such a practice is prohibited at the company.

  <li>Uber is expected to set a price range of $44 to $50 for its
  upcoming initial public offering, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.
  
  </li>
  <li>The ride-hailing company could raise between $8 billion and
  $10 billion in the public listing, according to the report, which
  added that the final details of that price range could still
  shift.

  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/uber">Uber</a>
  is expected to set a price range of $44 to $50 per share in a
  supersize <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/ipo">initial public
  offering (IPO)</a> that could fill the money-losing ride-hailing
  company's coffers with as much as $10 billion in capital,
  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-25/uber-is-said-to-plan-ipo-price-range-of-about-44-to-50-a-share?srnd=deals">
  Bloomberg reported on Thursday</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  The offering could give Uber a market value of as much as $90
  billion, putting the 10-year-old company in the upper echelons of
  publicly traded companies, Bloomberg reported. At that valuation,
  Uber would be worth more than the automakers Ford and Fiat
  Chrysler combined.
</p>
      <p>
  Uber, which <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000119312519103850/d647752ds1.htm">
  publicly filed</a> for its IPO on April 11, is expected to set an
  initial price range as soon as Friday, ahead of a planned road
  show to pitch the offering to investors.
</p>
      <p>
  Uber's IPO is the most highly anticipated of a crop of tech
  startups listing their shares on the public markets this year,
  including the social-networking firm Pinterest and the workplace
  messaging service Slack. 
</p>
      <p>
  Uber's ride-hailing rival Lyft <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lyft-raises-ipo-price-range-ahead-of-friday-ipo-2019-3">
  priced its March IPO</a> at $72 per share for a $21 billion
  valuation, even though its first price range was $62 to $68.
  However, this has backfired as the company has since traded below
  its IPO price. By market's close on Thursday, Lyft shares were
  trading at $56.39.

</p>
      <p>
  Uber could raise between $8 billion and $10 billion in the public
  offering, according to the Bloomberg report, which added that the
  final details of that price range could still shift. Uber hasn't
  officially disclosed how many shares it will have outstanding
  after its IPO, so it's unclear how this price range values the
  company. 
</p>
      <p>
  Though the first price range sets the tone of the conversation
  ahead of an IPO, all the big tech IPOs this year so far have gone
  public above their final range, including PagerDuty, Zoom, and
  Pinterest.

    <strong>Amazon made $2.7 billion during the first quarter from
    advertising, representing a 36% year-over-year jump.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ahead of earnings, Trip Miller, Gullane Capital
    Partners managing partner and Amazon shareholder, told Business
    Insider that advertising is one of the top two or three growth
    areas of the company.</strong>
  </li>

    <strong>Amazon has been ramping up its pitch to advertisers and
    is currently hiring 1,200 advertising roles across eight of its

      <p>
  Amazon's ad business is steadily growing but not as quickly as it
  has in the past.
</p>
      <p>
  During the first quarter of 2019, Amazon made $2.7 billion from
  advertising, which is labeled as a line item called
  "other." The ad revenue represents 36%
  year-over-year growth but is a dip from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-ad-business-is-bigger-than-ever-and-its-starting-to-make-inroads-with-big-brands-2019-1">
  the $3.4 billion</a> Amazon reported during fourth-quarter
  earnings.
</p>
      <p>
  While Amazon's ad business is bigger year-over-year for the
  quarter, its growth rate is plummeting. During the first quarter
  of 2018, Amazon's ad business grew at a 132% year-over-year to
  <a href="https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2018/05/this-just-in-amazons-ad-revenue-reaches-2-billion-in-q1-2018/">
  hit $2 billion.</a> And during the fourth quarter, the growth
  rate was 97% year-over-year, making the first-quarter's 36% jump
  a drastic change.

  Marketers say Amazon's advertising business is difficult to
  navigate. Here's why the company thinks the 'chaotic' structure
  actually makes sense.</a>
</p>
      <h2>
  Amazon wants to take on the duopoly
</h2>
      <p>
  The slowdown comes at a critical time for Amazon, which has been
  steadily angling for more share of the ad dollars that go to
  Facebook and Google.
</p>
      <p>
  According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/digital-advertising-is-bigger-than-ever-and-amazon-is-growing-fast-report-2019-2">
  research firm eMarketer,</a> Amazon's US ad business will grow
  more than 50% this year.
</p>
      <p>
  The company's also been staffing up its pitch to agencies,
  including hiring for 1,200 advertising roles across eight teams.
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-amazons-charm-offensive-to-win-over-madison-avenue-2019-4">
  According to agencies,</a> Amazon's been building out specific
  teams to service them and has stepped up its programmatic and
  video offerings.
</p>
      <p>
  Ahead of earnings, Amazon shareholder Trip Miller, managing
  partner of Gullane Capital Partners, said that advertising is one
  of the three biggest growth areas for Amazon and that it has an
  edge in going into "multiple, vertical opportunities" compared to
  other digital advertising companies.
</p>
      <p>
  "Other than regulation, Amazon is the biggest risk to Alphabet on
  the search side," he said. "If you're not doing business with
  Amazon, especially on the advertising side, over the next five
  years, you're losing."

  <li>My wife and I <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/all-nippon-airways-first-class-review-2019-4">recently flew first class to
    Japan on All Nippon Airways</a>, or ANA, by using credit card
    points - you can <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/credit-card-points-first-class-flight-japan-ana-2019-4">read more about exactly how we
    booked the flights here</a>.
  </li>
  <li>We used points from the stash we've earned by opening credit
  cards, earning their new membership bonuses, and using the right
  cards on the right purchases to maximize the rewards we earn.
  </li>
  <li>Here are the six cards I would recommend in order to book
  free flights - coach, business, or first class - using points.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  My wife and I recently flew round-trip to Japan in first class,
  and we only paid about $250 each in taxes and fees, plus 120,000
  credit card points. There were a few steps involved, but overall
  it was relatively easy - you can <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/credit-card-points-first-class-flight-japan-ana-2019-4">
  read exactly how I used points to book the flights booked the
  flights here</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  We earned the points for this flight - and for other ones - by
  opening new credit cards to earn their sign-up or welcome
  bonuses, and then optimizing the rewards we earn on our normal
  everyday spending.
</p>
      <p>
  The points we needed for this particular trip were actually easy
  to earn, as it was possible to use a mix of American Express,
  Chase, and Citi points.
</p>
      <p>
  I've either had, or currently have, each of the below cards, and
  their new-membership bonuses and rewards helped make it possible
  for us to sip $300 Champagne, eat fresh sashimi, and
  stretch out on a luxurious private bed at 35,000 feet.

  <strong><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/the-platinum-card-from-american-express/?utm_campaign=bi_ana_first_review_042419&amp;utm_source=referral">Platinum Card® from American
  Express</a></strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  The <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/the-platinum-card-from-american-express/?utm_campaign=bi_ana_first_review_042419&amp;utm_source=referral">
  AmEx Platinum</a> is one of my favorite cards, because even
  though it has a steep $550 annual fee, it offers a few benefits -
  like statement <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-amex-platinum-airline-credit">credits for airline fees</a>,
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-amex-platinum-uber-credit">Uber</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amex-platinum-100-dollar-saks-shopping-credit-2018-6">shopping</a> - that pretty much
  cover the fee.
</p>
      <p>
  Then there are the other benefits, like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/credit-card-with-best-airport-lounge-access-2018-8">airline lounge access</a>,
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amex-platinum-gold-status-hotel-benefits-hilton-marriott-starwood-2018-8">elite status</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-amex-fine-hotels-and-resorts">perks at hotels</a>, 5x points on
  flights purchased from the airline, and more. The card offers
  60,000 Membership Rewards points when you spend $5,000 in your
  first three months.

  <strong><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/the-american-express-gold-card/?utm_campaign=bi_ana_first_review_042419&amp;utm_source=referral">American Express® Gold
  Card</a></strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  The <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/the-american-express-gold-card/?utm_campaign=bi_ana_first_review_042419&amp;utm_source=referral">
  AmEx Gold Card</a> is a relaunch of the old Premier Rewards Gold
  card, but the new version is a serious upgrade. It offers 4x
  points per dollar spent at US restaurants and on the first
  $25,000 spent each year at supermarkets (1x point after that), 3x
  points on flights booked directly with the airline, and 1x point
  on everything else.
</p>
      <p>
  It has a $250 annual fee, but up to $220 each year in dining and
  airline fee credits should offset that. It offers a generous
  35,000 points after you spend $2,000 in the first three months.

  Card</a></strong> (currently offering its
  highest-ever sign-up bonus!)
</h2>
      <p>
  The <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/chase-sapphire-preferred-card/?utm_campaign=bi_ana_first_review_042419&amp;utm_source=referral">
  Sapphire Preferred</a> is one of the all-time greats of the
  credit card rewards game, and it remains a powerhouse. It offers
  2x points per dollar spent on all dining and travel - even if
  you're abroad - and comes with benefits like primary rental car
  insurance and trip delay coverage.
</p>
      <p>
  Best of all, Chase just increased the card's sign-up bonus for
  the first time since 2015: You'll get 60,000 points after
  spending $4,000 in the first three months. That's a killer value
  for a card with a $95 annual fee.

  <strong><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/chase-sapphire-reserve/?utm_campaign=bi_ana_first_review_042419&amp;utm_source=referral">Chase Sapphire
  Reserve</a></strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  A new entrant in 2016, the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/chase-sapphire-reserve/?utm_campaign=bi_ana_first_review_042419&amp;utm_source=referral">
  Chase Sapphire Reserve</a> was a groundbreaking credit card, at
  the time offering the best available rewards on dining and
  travel: 3x points per dollar spent. While the card has a $450
  annual fee, it gives $300 in credits to cover travel expenses
  each year, bringing the effective fee down to $150.
</p>
      <p>
  It offers airline lounge access - though <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/credit-card-with-best-airport-lounge-access-2018-8">more limited than the Platinum
  Card's</a> - robust travel protections, and more. The one
  downside is a slightly lower bonus than the Preferred's: 50,000
  points after spending $4,000 in the first three months.

  <strong><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/chase-freedom-unlimited//?utm_campaign=bi_ana_first_review_042419&amp;utm_source=referral">Chase Freedom
  Unlimited</a></strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  The <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/chase-freedom-unlimited//?utm_campaign=bi_ana_first_review_042419&amp;utm_source=referral">
  Chase Freedom Unlimited</a> is marketed as a cash back card, but
  actually earns Chase Ultimate Rewards points that can be pooled
  with points earned from other cards. It earns 1.5% cash - or 1.5x
  points per dollar spent - on all purchases across the board.
</p>
      <p>
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chase-freedom-unlimited-cash-back-rewards-credit-card-3-percent">Instead</a> of a traditional
  sign-up bonus, it currently offers an extra 1.5x points - so a
  total of 3x points per dollar - on up to $20,000 for your first
  year with the card (and 1.5x after that). Best of all, the card
  has no annual fee.
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/citi-thankyou-premier-sign-up-bonus-offer-2018-8">Citi Premier Card</a></strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  The Citi Premier is often overlooked, but is a fairly solid
  rewards card. Citi ThankYou Rewards points can be trickier to get
  top value from than Chase or AmEx points, but with a bit of
  effort it's absolutely possible, especially if you have the
  Premier.
</p>
      <p>
  It earns 2x points per dollar on all travel - including gas
  stations, which the Chase cards don't count as travel - 2x points
  at restaurants and on entertainment, and 1x point on everything
  else. It offers 50,000 points when you spend $4,000 in the first
  three months, and waives its $95 annual fee for the first year.

  Ford on Thursday posted lower profit for the first quarter but
  beat analysts' estimates as pickup truck sales remained strong in
  its core US market.
</p>
      <p>
  The No. 2 American automaker posted a quarterly net profit of
  $1.15 billion, or 29 cents per share, down 34 percent from $1.74
  billion, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.
</p>

  Excluding one-time items, Ford earned 44 cents per share, above
  analysts' average estimate of 27 cents, according to IBES data
  from Refinitiv.
</p>
      <p>
  In after-hours trading, Ford shares surged over 7%, to $10.

  AT&amp;T's controversial "5G E" symbol, which tech media often
  refers to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/sprint-warns-customers-dont-be-fooled-by-atts-fake-5g/">"fake 5G,"</a> is becoming an
  official part of the Android operating system, according to
  <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/att-fake-5ge-icon-added-aosp/">XDA-Developers</a>
  on Thursday.
</p>
      <p>
  So far, Samsung phones have been showing AT&amp;T's 5G E symbol.
  Officially adding AT&amp;T's 5G E symbol to the Android operating
  system means that more Android phones made by other companies
  could also adopt the symbol. It's unclear when, or if, more
  Android smartphone companies will adopt AT&amp;T's 5G E symbol. 
</p>
      <p>
  iPhones running on the latest version of Apple's iOS mobile
  operating system <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/iphones-on-att-now-show-5g-e-symbol-what-it-means-2019-3">
  also show AT&amp;T's 5G E</a> symbol.
</p>
      <p>
  AT&amp;T's 5G Evolution network is actually a rebranding of
  the carrier's LTE Advanced Pro (LTE AP) network. Most recent
  phones can connect to their carrier's own LTE Advanced networks.
  When a smartphone shows that its connected to AT&amp;T's 5G E
  network, users don't experience faster speeds on the same phone
  as they did before they saw the symbol. 
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oneplus-7-pro-launch-may-14-2019-4">
  The best smartphone maker you've never heard of is announcing a
  new smartphone in May that's expected to have a more advanced
  display than the iPhone or Galaxy S10</a>.</em>
</p>
      <p>
  To be clear, AT&amp;T's 5G E network is not 5G, the next
  big upgrade to wireless technology that will deliver super-fast
  speeds.
</p>
      <p>
  AT&amp;T's controversial 5G E -or "5G Evolution" -
  marketing campaign has been criticized for confusing consumers
  about 5G.
</p>
      <p>
  Indeed, tech billionaire <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/atts-5g-e-symbol-even-fooled-tech-billionaire-marc-benioff-2019-4">
  Marc Benioff was recently duped by AT&amp;T's 5G E</a> symbol
  where he briefly believed he was connected to a legitimate 5G
  network. Anecdotally, two friends of mine also believed they were
  connected to AT&amp;T's real 5G network, when in fact they were
  simply connected to the network they've always been connected to
  - AT&amp;T's LTE AP network. 
</p>
      <p>
  One recent report showed that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/att-5g-e-performance-not-faster-than-verizon-t-mobile-lte-network-2019-3">
  AT&amp;T's 5G E network was actually slower</a> than other
  carriers' 4G LTE networks. Not only does that look bad for
  AT&amp;T, but it looks bad for 5G.
</p>
      <p>
  Still, AT&amp;T is building out its legitimate 5G network,
  which is currently <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/att-turns-5g-network-on-in-7-new-cities-first-supported-phone-arrives-spring-2019-4">
  available in parts of 19 cities</a> across the US. The only
  problem is that AT&amp;T doesn't sell a smartphone that can
  actually connect to its 5G network in those cities. The only
  device that AT&amp;T sells that can connect to its 5G network is
  a 5G hotspot.
</p>
      <p>
  Meanwhile, Verizon announced on Thursday that it's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g-pre-orders-available-on-verizon-20-new-5g-cities-2019-4">
  accepting pre-orders for the $1,300 Samsung Galaxy S10 5G</a>
  smartphone that the carrier expects to be delivered by May 16.
  The Galaxy S10 5G will be able to connect to the Verizon's
  existing 5G networks in Minneapolis and Chicago, and eventually
  to the 20 extra cities that Verizon also announced on Thursday.

  As of this writing, Anna Mason is preparing to go on the eighth
  "Rise of the Rest" bus tour, which will take her and the rest of
  the team on a four-day trip through Florida and, after a quick
  flight, to San Juan, Puerto Rico.
</p>
      <p>
  The tour is the signature event for AOL founder Steve Case's
  initiative of the same name, run through his Washington, DC-based
  venture capital firm, Revolution. Since joining the team in 2016,
  Mason has expanded the scope of the tours and become a partner
  for the $150 million Rise of the Rest Seed Fund. It's dedicated
  to developing startup economies in US cities that are outside of
  Silicon Valley, New York, or Boston, where 75% of all US venture
  capital goes.
</p>
      <p>
  For her work in taking Case's vision to the next level, we've
  named her one of Business Insider's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-100-people-transforming-the-world-of-business-2019-4">
  100 People Transforming Business</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  Mason personally meets with 400 to 500 people in every city
  within the initiative's network, and vets about just as many
  companies. "I sometimes refer to myself as the human social
  network," she said.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-case-rise-of-the-rest-revolution-startup-culture-2018-5">
  AOL cofounder Steve Case is betting $150 million that the future
  of startups isn't in Silicon Valley or New York, but the money
  isn't what's making his prediction come true</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  After the next tour concludes, there will be 43 cities (or
  regions) in the Rise of the Rest network, and Mason will continue
  conversations throughout them, long after the tour bus leaves.
</p>

          <h1>After the upcoming tour, the map will also include Orlando, "the Space Coast," Tampa Bay, Miami, and Puerto Rico (centered on San Juan).</h1>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
  When Mason and her team go into a new city, she uses three
  questions to guide her: How is what I'm seeing innovative? Why
  are the opportunities here tied specifically to the city? How are
  the people special?
</p>
      <p>
  If she's meeting promising entrepreneurs, she then needs to
  determine if the city could maintain a full startup ecosystem.
  She looks for areas to be both physically and digitally
  well-connected, to show that they would benefit from the
  spectacle of the day tour and accompanying pitch contest, and for
  proof that successful startups drive more investment and regional
  growth.
</p>
      <p>
  Americans have become increasingly skeptical of Silicon Valley
  companies interfering with their lives and communities, and Mason
  said she's aware of that. It's why, she explained, she spends so
  much time in Rise of the Rest cities getting to know local
  founders, politicians, and power brokers. She wants her team to
  come in as allies, not outsiders who have all the answers.
</p>
      <p>
  "There's something really powerful about meeting people where
  they are," she said.

  <li>At 88 years old, Warren Buffett still comes to work every day
  and eats chicken nuggets three times a week - and he has no plans
  of stopping either of those.
  </li>
  <li>"I'm not bothered by the thought of my death," Buffett said
  in a new interview with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/40b9b356-661e-11e9-a79d-04f350474d62">
    Financial Times</a>. The Oracle of Omaha revealed he has no
    plans of retiring as Berkshire Hathaway CEO anytime soon.
  </li>
  <li>Buffett's diet also includes daily sodas, ample salt,
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-diet-2017-10#by-tuesday-afternoon-i-was-not-feeling-well-8">
    and very few veggies</a>.

</ul>
      <p>
  At 88 years old, Warren Buffett is still living life to the
  fullest.
</p>
      <p>
  To Buffett, that means going to work - which he calls a "vacation
  every day" - and eating McDonald's for lunch at least three times
  a week. 
</p>
      <p>
  The CEO of holding company Berkshire Hathaway and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-net-worth-berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-coke-mcdonalds-2019-4">
  the world's third-richest man</a> revealed his peculiar lifestyle
  habits in a three-hour long interview with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/40b9b356-661e-11e9-a79d-04f350474d62">
  Financial Times</a>. Buffett told FT he has no plans to retire;
  while his old age means he must wear a hearing aid and avoid
  driving at night, he still "jumps out of bed" to go to work.
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>
    <em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-net-worth-berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-coke-mcdonalds-2019-4">
    Warren Buffett, the third-richest person in the world, is also
    one of the most frugal billionaires. Here's how he makes and
    spends his fortune.</a></em>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  Along with Buffett's thrice-weekly McDonald's chicken nuggets
  habit, a quarter of Buffett's caloric intake comes from drinking
  Coke. "I'm not bothered by the thought of my death," the CEO told
  the FT.
</p>
      <p>
  The Oracle of Omaha doesn't shy away from talking about his
  unusual diet. Buffett <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-diet-2017-10#for-lunch-i-went-back-and-found-one-of-buffetts-go-to-lunch-orders-at-gorats-an-omaha-nebraska-institution-11">
  eats mostly junk food and soda, with very little vegetables</a>.
  Along with McDonald's, Buffett gulps down <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-on-coke-annual-meeting-2016-4">
  five cans of Coca-Cola</a> products a day, eats Dairy Queen ice
  cream, and munches on <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/05/05/warren-buffett-elon-musk-trolling-sees-candies-moats/">
  </a><a href="http://fortune.com/2018/05/05/warren-buffett-elon-musk-trolling-sees-candies-moats/">See's
  Candies</a>. 
</p>
      <p>
  The CEO also uses so much salt, former Wells Fargo CEO John
  Stumpf said <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wells-fargo-ceo-warren-eats-a-full-meal-2014-9">
  "</a><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wells-fargo-ceo-warren-eats-a-full-meal-2014-9">it's
  a snowstorm"</a> every time Buffett uses a salt shaker. 
</p>
      <p>
  While he has no plans to retire, Buffett spoke frankly about
  trusting a successor to one day run the company after he passes.
  Without "capitalism's favorite grandpa" running the show, as FT
  put it, Buffett said he expects Berkshire Hathaway will continue
  to thrive due to the community he created among shareholders and
  employees, as well as Buffett's insistence of not over-promising
  on returns.
</p>
      <p>
  Until that day, Buffett has no plans of quitting work (or chicken
  nuggets): "I have more fun here than I think any
  88-year-old is having, virtually, in the world," he said.

    <strong>Intel reported revenues of about $16.1 billion for the

    period, though. </strong>
  </li>
  <li>

      <p>Intel stock fell more than 6%, or $3.46, after CEO Bob Swan said the company is "taking a more cautious view of the year" as it cut its forecast for the next quarter. On an earnings call with investors, Swan said that the company's caution comes from factors including inventory issues and weak demand in China.</p>
      <p>
    In its first quarterly report card since Swan took the
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/analysts-say-intel-ceo-bob-swan-is-a-great-choice-2019-2">
    reins as permanent CEO</a> in January, Intel reported
    revenue of about $16.1 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of
    $0.89 for the first three months of 2019, roughly in line with
    Wall Street expectations. Notably, that revenue figure is
    roughly flat from the same period of 2018.
  </p>
      <p>
    At the same time, Intel gave a gloomier forecast for the next
    quarter and the full year, slashing its forecast revenue and
    earnings well below Wall Street expectations. Intel now expects
    to generate $69 billion in revenue for the full 2019 year,
    versus Wall Street analyst consensus of $71.05 billion. 
  </p>
      <p>"Looking ahead, we're taking a more cautious view of the year, although we expect market conditions to improve in the second half," Swan said in a statement.</p>
      <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>EPS (adjusted):</strong>  $0.89, versus Wall Street
    expectations of $0.87.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Revenue:</strong> $16.06 billion, versus $16.02
    billion expected. This figure is roughly flat from the same
    period of 2018.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>EPS (next quarter):</strong> $0.89. Wall Street
    predicted $1.01.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Revenue (next quarter):</strong>
    $15.6 billion. Analysts forecasted $16.85
    billion.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  It's been a busy period for the chipmaker, and investors
  are keen for more details on Intel's surprise move to exit the
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/intel-quits-the-5g-smartphone-modem-business-2019-4">
  5G smartphone-chip business</a> and about how demand is holding
  up for data-center products amid ongoing economic
  uncertainty.
</p>
      <p>
  "We recently sharpened our 5G
  focus," Swan said on the earnings call. "When it became clear we
  don't have a clear path to profitability in 5G modems, we acted.
  We are now winding down that business ... By acting now, we focus our 5G efforts on the
  transformation of the wireless network and edge
  infrastructure."
</p>
      <p>
  Last quarter, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/intel-q3-2018-earnings-live-2019-1">
  Intel missed</a> Wall Street's expectations on revenue and
  earnings, and the stock plunged 8%. Swan, who was the interim CEO
  at the time, said that trade concerns in China had
  "intensified."

  <li>Former Vice President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">
    Joe Biden</a> announced a 2020 presidential run on Thursday,
    the third attempt of his career.
  </li>
  <li>Biden immediately began racking up high profile endorsements,
  including several senators from outside his home state.
  </li>
  <li>Biden is the 20th candidate to enter the 2020 presidential
  race on the Democratic side.

      <p>
  Former Vice President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">
  Joe Biden</a> immediately received several high profile
  endorsements upon <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-vice-president-joe-biden-running-for-president-2020-2019-1">
  announcing his 2020 presidential campaign</a> Thursday.
</p>
      <p>
  The slew of endorsements and prominent backers suggest Biden is
  looking to build a strong coalition of support from across the
  Democratic Party.

  <em>Joe Biden is running for president in 2020. Here's everything
  we know about the candidate and how he stacks up against the
  competition</em></a>
</p>
      <p>
  There are six sitting senators also running for president in
  2020. Within an hour of Biden's announcement, more senators had
  endorsed the former vice president than any of their colleagues
  in the race who have been running for several months.
</p>
      <p>
  Shortly after Biden's announcement early Thursday morning,
  Democratic Sens. Chris Coons and Tom Carper of Delaware threw
  their support behind Biden, a longtime senator from the first
  state in the union. Delaware's at-large Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester
  also endorsed Biden.
</p>
      <p>
  "We are at a crucial moment in our history," Coons said in a
  statement. "We need leaders who will bring us together instead of
  tearing us apart, who will focus on the real issues facing
  American families, and who will restore the United States' role
  in the world as a force for stability, freedom and human rights.
  Joe Biden is that leader, and I'm proud to endorse him for
  President of the United States."
</p>
      <p>
  Outside Biden's home state, Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, who is
  facing a tough re-election fight in 2020, also endorsed the
  former vice president, followed by Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey
  and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
</p>
      <p>
  "The quality that makes Joe stand out is his ability to
  bring people together to find common ground while standing up for
  what he believes is right," Jones <a href="https://twitter.com/DougJones/status/1121381353117843456">wrote
  on Twitter</a>. "We need to listen to each other &amp; get things
  done for working people. Joe can, and will, do that. That's why I
  support Joe Biden."
</p>
      <p>
  In addition, Biden managed to earn support from several House
  lawmakers, including Reps. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, Thomas
  Suozzi of New York, as well as Brendan Boyle and Matt Cartwright,
  who are from Pennsylvania.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more:</strong></em> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/barack-obama-does-not-formally-endorse-joe-biden-after-2020-announcement-2019-4">
  <em>Joe Biden says he told Obama not to formally endorse
  him</em></a>
</p>
      <p>
  Biden also received a supportive statement from former President
  Barack Obama, which stopped short of a full endorsement. Biden
  told reporters that he personally requested Obama not endorse
  him, as he is looking to court support on his own merits.
</p>
      <p>
  One endorsement came from an unlikely place when anti-Trump
  attorney Michael Avenatti wrote on Twitter he would be backing
  Biden.
</p>
      <p>"I am extremely happy that @JoeBiden has decided to enter the race," Avenatti wrote. "He offers Dems the very best chance in 2020, especially in key states. He has the fight, intelligence and fortitude to beat Trump and begin to make America, America again. He has my enthusiastic support."</p>
      <p>
    Avenatti, who at one point was mulling a 2020 presidential run
    for himself, lost a lot of his favor in the Democratic Party
    for both his handling of a female accusing Supreme Court
    Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, as well as
    recently being <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-avenatti-indicted-36-counts-financial-fraud-faces-335-years-2019-4">
    indicted for 36 counts of financial crimes</a>.
  </p>
      <p>
    Shortly after endorsing Biden, Avenatti set his Twitter account
    to private.

      <ul>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/facebook">Facebook</a>
    doesn't let you know when you've <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-unblock-someone-on-facebook">
    been blocked</a> by another user, but there are a number of
    indications that can help you find out.  </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Being blocked has many of the same effects as being
    unfriended, such as someone's posts not appearing in your
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/facebook">Facebook</a>
    feed, and being unable to tag them in posts.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Some signs are more obvious, such as the fact that you
    can't search for them on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/facebook">Facebook,</a>
    visit their profile page, or send them <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/facebook-messenger">Facebook
    Messages</a>.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">Visit
    Business Insider's homepage for more stories.</a></strong>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/facebook">Facebook</a>
  doesn't give you any sort of notification when <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-unblock-someone-on-facebook">
  someone blocks you</a>, so it can be mysterious, because it might
  not be immediately apparent that this is what has
  happened.
</p>
      <p>
  But while there's no obvious
  status message on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/facebook">Facebook</a>
  that confirms you've been blocked by someone, there are some
  signs you can check for to figure it out on your own.
</p>
      <h2>
  How to tell if someone has blocked you on Facebook
</h2>
      <p>
  When someone blocks you, some of
  the signs are similar to being unfriended. Here are some things
  you will notice:
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>They're not in your Friends list.</strong> If you are friends with the person and
    they've disappeared from your friends list, it either means
    they have unfriended you or blocked you. To check, go to your
    own profile page (on the web, click on your name at the top of
    the screen, or on your phone, tap the three horizontal lines to
    open the menu and tap your name. Then check your
    Friends).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You can't tag that person in posts.</strong>
    If you are friends with this
    person, you should be able to tag them in a post - if you
    can't, it either means they have unfriended you or blocked you.
    Create a post and either click or tap "Tag People." Enter their
    name; if the name doesn't appear and let you select it, that's
    a strong signal.
  </li>
</ul>

        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc1fd87daa9a9470e6dd697-1920-1537.jpg"/>
        <figcaption class="op-medium op-left">
          <h1>If Facebook won't autocomplete someone's name, they might be blocking you.</h1>
          <cite>Dave Johnson/Business Insider</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>You can't invite that person to events or
    groups</strong>. Likewise, if
    you create an event (on the web, click "Events" and then
    "Create Event;" on your phone, tap the three horizontal lines,
    tap "Events," and then tap "Create") and find that you can't
    invite the person, they've unfriended or blocked you.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You can no longer see their posts in your Facebook
    feed</strong>. Finally, if you
    had been friends and their posts no longer populate your
    Facebook feed, that's an indication of unfriending or
    blocking.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  There are three other fairly
  clear indications that you've been blocked.
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>You can't find the person in search.</strong>
    Ordinarily, you should be able
    to find any Facebook user by typing their name in the search
    box at the top of Facebook's web page. If you enter their name
    in the search box and they no longer appear, though, that's a
    sign that person is blocking you.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You can't send the person messages in Facebook
    Messenger</strong>. If you were
    previously friends and try to send a message, you will see an
    error message that says the user is unavailable.
  </li>
</ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cc1fdac745653626d505934-1536-1647.jpg"/>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>You can't see the person's profile
    page</strong>. If you try to
    navigate directly to his or her profile page (such as by
    clicking their name in a Facebook Messenger window), Facebook
    will display an error that says the user is unavailable.

  Some are pioneering new ways to treat diseases and care for

  In our conversations with those leaders, we asked them to

</p>
      <h2>
  Changing the way we practice healthcare
</h2>
      <p>
  Some highlighted controversial additions to medicine. 
</p>
      <p>
  "For better or for worse, it's the use of computers in
  healthcare," Rushika Fernandopulle, the CEO of primary care
  company Iora Health said. Computers in doctor's offices have been
  villainized, with electronic health records taking up more and
  more of doctor's time, diverting their attention away from
  patients. 
</p>
      <p>
  But in the grand scheme of things, it has moved healthcare away
  from a system of paper charts and records to one stored on
  still-error-prone devices. 
</p>
      <p>
  Relatedly, now that we have more computers in healthcare,
  companies have figured out ways to use the information collected
  to ideally keep us healthier, a transition that's been taken for
  granted as well, Aetna President Karen Lynch said.
</p>
      <p>
  "The one thing I would say is the digital access we have," Lynch
  said. For instance, she noted, public health efforts to get more
  people to come in for their flu shots can be more targeted based
  on information about who's already received their annual vaccine.
  
</p>
      <p>
  And slowly but surely, procedures you once had to get taken care
  of within the four walls of the hospital are moving to other,
  less expensive locations to operate. 
</p>
      <p>
  "What's changed the most is simply where you're receiving your
  care," Oak HC/FT managing partner and cofounder Annie Lamont
  said. 
</p>
      <h2>
  Vaccines have done a thankless job preventing disease
</h2>
      <p>
  One of the biggest aspects of medicine that's been entirely taken
  for granted has been vaccines. Vaccines have been around for
  centuries, preventing diseases like smallpox. 
</p>
      <p>

  <em>The FDA's top leader says anti-vaxxers could bring about a
  national health crisis</em></a>  
</p>
      <p>
  But because vaccines have done such a good job of preventing
  diseases, people haven't fully appreciated all they do, Merck CEO
  Ken Frazier said. 
</p>
      <p>
  "Many diseases have become invisible in parts of the world due to
  vaccination, so I think many people aren't fully aware of the
  devastation these diseases can cause," Frazier said. "It's been
  disconcerting, to see distrust being spread regarding science and
  our scientific institutions. This had had an impact on
  vaccination rates and is bringing these forgotten diseases back
  into the fore."
</p>
      <p>
  For instance, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-us-measles-case-counts-soar-to-highest-official-tally-since-2000-2019-4">
  measles has been gaining a foothold in the US</a> and Europe. In
  2000, public health officials declared that measles had been
  eliminated in the US. In 2019, there have been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-us-measles-case-counts-soar-to-highest-official-tally-since-2000-2019-4">
  nearly 700 cases of a disease</a> that used to have just a couple
  dozen cases each year. Frazier is hopeful that will bring some
  appreciation for the role vaccines play in preventing disease. 
</p>
      <p>
  "With the measles outbreaks in the U.S. and Europe, it seems that
  the scales are beginning to tip, and we are seeing more
  collective action fighting this misinformation," Frazier.

  <li>Steven Schonfeld's hedge fund Schonfeld Strategic Advisors
  recruited a top quant from Engineers Gate, Ricky Shi, to run a
  new quant fund, sources tell Business Insider.
  </li>
  <li>Schonfeld's fund has expanded into Asia and Europe recently,
  primarily through its acquisition of hedge fund Folger Hill in
  2018.
  </li>
  <li>Quants like Shi are in high demand as traditional
  stock-picking funds and computer-driven managers are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hedge-funds-competing-with-startups-for-talent-2019-4">
    fighting Silicon Valley for this talent</a>. 
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  Ricky Shi is going from working for one billionaire to another. 
</p>
      <p>
  Shi, the head of supported portfolio managers and a quant trader
  at Glenn Dubin's Engineers Gate, has been tapped by Steven
  Schonfeld to run a new quant fund under Schonfeld Strategic
  Advisors' umbrella, sources tell Business Insider.
</p>
      <p>
  Shi joined Engineers Gate, which was founded by Dubin in 2014, as
  one of the firm's first employees, according to his LinkedIn
  profile, working as a quant trader and analyst at first. Dubin,
  who made his fortune off Highbridge Capital which he co-founded
  with Henry Swieca and eventually sold to JPMorgan. Engineers Gate
  currently runs more than $2 billion in assets, according to
  regulatory filings.

</p>
      <p>
  Schonfeld has been looking to grow his eponymous fund recently,
  after deciding in 2015 to start taking outside capital again. The
  firm has opened an office in London this year, and purchased
  rival fund Folger Hill with the hopes of getting more exposure to
  Asia. 
</p>
      <p>
  Schonfeld, Engineers Gate, and Shi all declined to comment. Shi's
  LinkedIn currently states that he is under a non-compete and is

      <p>
  Wall Street had heady expectations for Amazon's first-quarter
  profits. Amazon topped them.
</p>
      <p>
  But the company warned that it wouldn't have such happy news next
  quarter.
</p>
      <p>
  The retail and cloud-computing giant on Thursday reported
  earnings per share of $7.09. That's about 50% higher than what
  analysts were expecting.
</p>
      <p>
  But it warned that its revenue and earnings for the second
  quarter could fall shy of analysts' estimates. In the case of its
  bottom line, the shortfall could be dramatic. The midpoint of the
  range the company provided for its second-quarter operating
  profit was $1.2 billion below what analysts had previously
  expected.
</p>
      <p>
  For investors, that disappointing forecast seemed to temper their
  excitement over Amazon's outstanding first-quarter earnings. In
  recent after-hours trading, the company's stock was up a modest
  $28.01, or about 1%, to $1,930.26 a share.
</p>
      <p>
  Here's what the company reported and how it compared with Wall
  Street's expectations and Amazon's prior-year results:
</p>
      <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Q1 revenue:</strong> $59.7 billion. Analysts had
    forecast $59.68 billion. In the same period a year ago, Amazon
    recorded $51.04 billion in sales.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Q1 EPS (GAAP):</strong> $7.09. Wall Street had
    predicted earnings per share of $4.67. The company posted a
    profit of $3.27 a share in the first quarter last year.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Q2 revenue (company guidance):</strong> $59.5 billion
    to $63.5 billion. Analysts had previously forecast sales of
    $62.37 billion for the period. In the second quarter last year,
    Amazon brought in $52.9 billion in sales.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Q2 EPS (guidance):</strong> The company didn't offer
    earnings guidance but said it expected to post an operating
    profit of $2.6 billion to $3.6 billion. Before the report,
    analysts were predicting it would post an operating profit of
    $4.2 billion and earnings per share of $6.34. The e-commerce
    giant posted operating income of $3 billion and per share
    earnings of $5.07 in the same period of 2018.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  Amazon's stock closed regular trading up $0.50, or less than 1%,
  to $1,902.25.
</p>
      <h2>
  AWS's revenue growth topped 40% yet again
</h2>
      <p>
  The company's results were boosted again by its Amazon Web
  Services cloud-computing business, which has been helping drive
  Amazon's growth over the past several years. Accounting for
  foreign-exchange fluctuations, AWS' sales jumped 42% in the
  period from the first quarter last year to $7.7 billion. AWS has
  grown at an annual clip of between 40 and 50% since the first
  quarter of 2017.
</p>
      <p>
  The cloud-computing unit posted an operating profit of $2.2
  billion in the period, up 59% from the year-ago quarter. AWS
  accounted for about half of Amazon's total operating income for
  the first quarter.
</p>
      <p>
  The company's North American business also posted a solid
  quarter. The unit posted sales of $35.8 billion, up a relatively
  modest 17% from the same period last year. But its operating
  income nearly doubled over the same time frame to $2.3 billion.
</p>
      <p>
  Amazon's big earnings outperformance, though, largely came from
  holding the line on its biggest expenses. While the company's
  overall revenue grew 17% from the first quarter last year, its
  cost of sales, which includes the wholesale prices it pays for
  the products it sells to consumers, grew by just 10%. Likewise,
  its fulfillment and general and administrative costs grew by just
  10%.
</p>
      <p>
  On a conference call with analysts, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's
  chief financial officer, said that Amazon invested heavily in its
  fulfillment and data centers in 2016 and 2017. It has since been
  waiting for its business to catch up with the capacity it created
  then, he said.
</p>
      <p>
  The company expects to ramp up such spending starting in the
  second quarter, he said. Since Amazon launched its Prime
  subscription service, one of the offering's key features has been
  free two-day shipping on many items in the company's store.
  Amazon <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-changes-prime-shipping-one-day-2019-4">
  plans to instead offer free one-day shipping as a default
  standard on those items</a>, Olsavsky said. In connection with
  that change the company expects its expenses to increase
  incrementally by $800 million in the next quarter, he said.
</p>
      <p>
  "We're taking a significant step," he said, adding, "it will take
  us time to achieve."
</p>
      <h2>
  Amazon's ad business saw a slowdown
</h2>
      <p>
  But Amazon's first-quarter results also included some
  disappointing nuggets. One big one is that its advertising
  business, which had been growing exceptionally, saw a marked
  slowdown in its growth in the quarter.
</p>
      <p>
  The company posted $2.7 billion in the first quarter of "other"
  revenue, a category that largely consists of its advertising
  sales. That amount was up 36% from the same period a year
  earlier, excluding foreign exchange changes.
</p>
      <p>
  That's a healthy growth rate, but it's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-q1-2019-ad-business-plunges-to-36-year-over-year-growth-2019-4">
  dramatically lower than what Amazon was recording as recently as
  the fourth quarter</a> last year. In the holiday period, its
  "other" revenue grew by 97% on an annual basis. And in the first
  three quarters of last year, Amazon's "other" revenue grew by
  more than 100% annually.
</p>
      <p>
  On the call, Olsavsky said the "other" category included items
  other than just advertising. Amazon's ad business actually grew
  "a bit" faster than the 36% rate for the entire "other" area, he
  said, but he did not specify the rate of growth. Despite
  questions from analysts, Olsavsky declined to offer an
  explanation for the slowdown in advertising revenue growth or
  whether analysts and investors should expect it to continue to
  grow at this rate going forward.
</p>
      <p>
  Part of the explanation for the decline in growth rates has to do
  with an accounting change Amazon adopted last year. Before the
  accounting change, the company classified some advertising
  revenue as a reduction in the cost of its sales. After the
  accounting change, it recognized the revenue as part of its
  "other" revenue category. The effect was a one-time boost last
  year in its reported revenue and growth rates for the "other"
  category.
</p>
      <p>
  Because this year's "other" revenue numbers directly compare with
  last year's, the year-over-year growth rates haven't been
  artificially boosted by the accounting change. Without that
  accounting boost, Amazon's "other" revenue would have grown by
  38% in the fourth quarter last year, or only marginally higher
  than the rate it posted in the first quarter, an Amazon
  representative told Business Insider in an email.
</p>
      <p>
  Still, even taking the accounting change into account, the
  company's ad sales have slowed dramatically over time. As
  recently as the third quarter last year, Amazon's "other" revenue
  grew at a 51% rate without the accounting-change boost, according
  to the Amazon representative. On the same basis, the "other"
  category grew by 74% in the first quarter last year, the
  representative said.
</p>
      <p>
  Other areas of Amazon's business also posted what could be
  considered disappointing results. Its direct e-commerce business,
  where it sells goods directly to consumers through its website,
  grew by 12%, excluding currency fluctuations, to $29.5 billion.
  Meanwhile, the sales it generates from Whole Foods and its other
  physical stores grew by just 1% to $4.3 billion.
</p>
      <p>
  And its international segment grew by 16%, excluding foreign
  exchange changes, to $16.2 billion. As recently as the second
  quarter last year, that business was consistently growing at a
  rate faster than 20% annually.<a href="http://www.bussinessinsider.com/amazon-q1-2019-earnings-aws-advertising-retail-prime-2019-4"/>

    bags in 2000 to meet the needs of modern women who value both
    fashion and function.

    embodies these ideals and, for its timeless style and practical
    features, has been my go-to-bag since moving to New York City.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  A good bag is not only an integral
  part of your outfit but integral to the flow of your day. I need
  a bag that can hold my gym clothes for the morning, my lunch to
  bring to work, keep my metro card easily accessible so I don't
  create a line at the subway turnstile - and of course,
  look nice enough that I can feel good about bringing it out to
  dinner at a nice restaurant. If you think that's a lot to ask
  from a bag, you haven't met <a href="http://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGR0dMRkJGSEhLR01CRk5GRkZG?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mzwallace.com%2F">MZ Wallace</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  Monica Zwirner and Lucy Wallace Eustice, the company's founders
  and namesakes, <a href="http://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGR0dMRkJGSEhLR01CRk5GRkZG?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mzwallace.com%2F">set out to meet needs like
  mine</a> - and more - in 2000. Their goal was to create
  thoughtful, unique accessories for
  the modern woman.
</p>
      <p>
  As two native New Yorkers with experience in the fashion
  industry, they have a strong sense of what today's woman wants
  and what looks great. If there's a secret sauce to finding the
  fine line where fashion meets function, you can be sure MZ
  Wallace has it. In Manhattan, I spot their signature
  quilted-nylon just about everywhere I go - while I'm riding on
  the subway, waiting in the line at Trader Joe's, packing up in
  the locker room at the gym, or walking down the street. As an
  owner of an <a href="http://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGR0dMRkJGSEhLR01CRk5GRkZG?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mzwallace.com%2F">MZ Wallace</a> myself, I
  understand why the bags are popping up on shoulders everywhere
  - the brand just gets it.
</p>
      <p>
  MZ Wallace offers a wide variety of
  styles, from trendy little <a href="http://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGR0dMRkJGSEhLR01CRk5GRkZG?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mzwallace.com%2Fshop%2Fproducts%2F11841552%2Fdazzle-oxford-metro-belt-bag%2F21164.html%3F%26cgid%3D">belt bags</a> to <a href="http://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGR0dMRkJGSEhLR01CRk5GRkZG?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mzwallace.com%2Fshop%2Fproducts%2F11901401%2Flight-grey-camo-travel-jim%2F20968.html%3F%26cgid%3Dduffel">large weekender bags</a>, and
  plenty of shapes and sizes in between. After hearing friends and
  family rave about the bags for a while, I decided it would be a
  perfect work bag. I settled on getting the <a href="http://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGR0dMRkJGSEhLR01CRk5GRkZG?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mzwallace.com%2Fshop%2Fproducts%2F2890404%2Fmagnet-oxford-large-sutton%2F1735.html%3F%26cgid%3D">Large Sutton</a>, and it's since
  proved to be an amazing choice - I use it just about every day.
  
</p>
      <p>
  At $245, the <a href="http://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGR0dMRkJGSEhLR01CRk5GRkZG?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mzwallace.com%2Fshop%2Fproducts%2F2890404%2Fmagnet-oxford-large-sutton%2F1735.html%3F%26cgid%3D">Large Sutton bag</a> is not cheap,
  but I think the price is fair for what you get. For starters,
  you're paying for high-quality materials. The bag is made with a
  soft, lightweight nylon that's both water and stain-resistant - a
  feature that proves particularly important when braving the
  elements of city streets and crowded subways. I chose the color
  magnet, which is a nice, deep gray that's a great neutral for
  every day. There's a nice sheen on the quilted fabric, which,
  along with the nude leather accents and gold hardware, make the
  bag undeniably stylish. The look of the bag is timeless,
  something that you can wear with any outfit today, or in a few
  years. This all makes sense given both of the founders' fashion
  backgrounds, but what really sets the Large Sutton apart is its
  functionality.

      <p>
  It's like the founders of MZ
  Wallace predicted all of the qualms you <em>could</em> have with
  the bag and found the solutions before you even had the chance to
  experience any frustration. For example, since the bag is so
  large, it can get pretty heavy, depending on what you fill it
  with. If you find the handles - which are padded for extra
  comfort, by the way- to be too much to hold, clip on the
  adjustable nylon strap, convert the bag from a tote to a
  crossbody, and give your shoulder a break. You can also clip down
  the sides of the bag to make it smaller if you'd like it to be
  more compact. 
</p>
      <p>
  I've already made my case for the
  outside of the bag, but the interior of the <a href="http://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGR0dMRkJGSEhLR01CRk5GRkZG?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mzwallace.com%2Fshop%2Fproducts%2F2890404%2Fmagnet-oxford-large-sutton%2F1735.html%3F%26cgid%3D">Large Sutton</a> is just as
  impressive. To give you a sense of how much you can hold, it's
  large enough to fit a 15-inch laptop, and the inside has plenty
  of pockets and pouches to keep you organized. There are three
  detachable pockets - a
  small, medium, and large size -
  which I've found to be super practical. Keep the pouches clipped
  in the bag for easy access or un-clip them and move them around.
  I like to keep the pouches filled with some everyday necessities,
  like travel-sized toiletries and pens, in case I ever need. And,
  since the pouches are already full, I can easily move them to
  another bag.
</p>
      <p>
  You'll also find six interior pockets, some
  zippered and some open, to keep items easily accessible. The
  phone pocket keeps your device close for those inevitable times
  when you need it at a moment's notice. My personal favorite
  feature is the key ring strap, which saves me from fumbling for
  my keys at my front door, especially on those freezing New York
  nights. 
</p>
      <p>
  Ultimately, my purchase of an MZ
  Wallace bag proved to be a great move - and if you're looking for a bag that's equally
  smart and stylish, I think you might like this one.

  <li>Apps you don't use can be taking up unnecessary space on your
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/mac">Mac
  computer</a>, and causing it to run slowly.
  </li>
  <li>Deleting apps on a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/mac">Mac</a> can be as
  simple as clicking and dragging them into the trash, but removing
  the stored data they leave behind sometimes requires a little
  more work.
  </li>
  <li>Here's an easy how-to guide for uninstalling apps on your
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/mac">Mac</a>
  (and where to go to remove their stored files, too).

      <p>
  'Tis the season for throwing out
  the old to make room for the new and, as it turns out, your
  computer is likely due for a spring cleaning, too.
</p>
      <p>
  Between the regular backups and
  constant updates, technology takes almost as much maintenance as
  a house these days. If every time you power up your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/mac">Mac</a>, you get
  the dreaded "Startup disk is almost full" popup or an
  overwhelming number of update notifications on apps you don't
  even use, then it's probably time for a purge.
</p>
      <p>
  There are a number of
  <a href="https://macpaw.com/how-to/startup-disk-full-on-mac-os-x">
  files that could be taking up space on your
  Mac</a>, ultimately
  causing it to run slowly, but before you go dragging your beloved
  photos, music, and movies into the trash, you should consider
  uninstalling those apps you know you'll never use again.
</p>
      <p>
  Whether it's the Adobe trial you
  decided not to buy, or the software you downloaded for that one
  work-from-home day last year, these programs could be
  <a href="https://macpaw.com/how-to/fix-mac-running-slow">running in the background</a>
  or automatically updating without
  you even realizing it.
</p>
      <p>
  Even if they're not causing you
  any trouble, those regular update notifications are flat-out
  annoying. Uninstalling these apps is as satisfying as wiping the
  dust from your bookshelf, and often as easy, too.
</p>
      <p>
  Deleting an app (which is, in
  fact, synonymous with uninstalling it) will free up most of the
  space it's occupying on your computer. However, keep in mind that
  some apps like Microsoft Office and Adobe programs could actually
  be storing large amounts of files on your Mac even after you
  delete them.
</p>
      <p>
  Dragging an app into Trash only
  removes the .app file, not necessarily the data it has already
  saved on your Mac (including preferences, logins, and licensed
  files), <a href="https://macpaw.com/support/cleanmymac-3/knowledgebase/uninstalling-mac-applications-with-cleanmymac-3">
  according to
  MacPaw</a>. Going the
  extra mile to remove this stored data will free up even more
  space on your computer.
</p>
      <p>
  Some apps, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/installing-uninstalling-acrobat-x-mac.html">
  such as
  Adobe</a>, offer dedicated
  uninstallers - whether built into the app or downloaded
  separately from the manufacturer's website - that will remove
  additional, associated files. For those that don't, though, you
  can either <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/uninstall-office-for-mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3">
  manually delete files from your
  Library</a> or purchase a
  third-party program like <a href="https://cleanmymac.com/">CleanMyMac</a> to completely clear them away for you.
</p>
      <p>
  Here are three simple ways to
  uninstall App Store programs and other apps you've downloaded
  from the internet.  
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>How to manually uninstall apps on a Mac computer in three
  different ways</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  <strong>1.</strong> Click

  <li>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/datacamp">DataCamp</a>,
  a data science learning startup, disclosed that an executive
  made "uninvited physical contact" with an employee in
  October 2017 and that the company had taken "corrective actions"
  in response.
  </li>
  <li>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/datacamp-ceo-made-uninvited-physical-contact-with-employee-sources-say-2019-4">
    sources told Business Insider</a> that the unnamed executive
    was DataCamp CEO and cofounder Jonathan Cornelissen. When
    Business Insider reached out for comment, DataCamp declined to
    identify the executive.
  </li>
  <li>On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/board-update">DataCamp
  confirmed the executive involved in the incident was
  Cornelissen,</a> and that he would be stepping down
  "indefinitely" as CEO, pending an investigation into the
  incident.
  </li>
  <li>We spoke to DataCamp instructors who say that they're still
  unsatisfied with the company's response.

  The CEO of $184 million data science startup DataCamp is stepping
  down "indefinitely," after an allegation that he made "uninvited
  physical contact" with an employee in 2017 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/datacamp-ceo-made-uninvited-physical-contact-with-employee-sources-say-2019-4">
  came to light earlier this week</a>. 
</p>
      <p>
  Jonathan Cornelissen, the company's cofounder and CEO, is
  taking an unpaid "indefinite leave of absence" from the company,
  the DataCamp board of directors <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/board-update">wrote in a
  blog post</a> Wednesday night. His leave will begin on May 1st,
  and the board writes that it's "working through plans for interim
  leadership."
</p>
      <p>
  "We have learned a lot from the community over the last
  several weeks and recognize that the company hasn't listened
  nearly enough to you over the last 18 months," the board wrote in
  the blog post. It also said that it is "fully committed to
  regaining your trust as a community."
</p>

  The CEO of a data-science-learning startup worth $184 million
  made 'uninvited physical contact' with an employee while dancing
  at a bar, sources say</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Earlier in April, DataCamp published a blog post revealing
  that an unnamed executive had "danced inappropriately" with an
  employee while at an "informal employee gathering" at a bar in
  October 2017. The company said that it had taken "corrective
  actions," including sensitivity training and personal coaching
  for this person, as well as "a strong warning that the company
  will not tolerate any such behavior in the future."
</p>
      <p>
  On Monday, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/datacamp-ceo-made-uninvited-physical-contact-with-employee-sources-say-2019-4">
  Business Insider reported that</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/datacamp-ceo-made-uninvited-physical-contact-with-employee-sources-say-2019-4">
  Cornelissen</a>, who has served as CEO since the company was
  founded in 2013, was the executive in question. At the time,
  DataCamp declined to disclose the executive's identity. 
</p>
      <p>
  But on Wednesday, the company's board of directors confirmed that
  Cornelissen was indeed the executive involved in an incident with
  a former DataCamp employee. In a <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/apology">separate blog
  post</a> published on Wednesday night, Cornelissen appeared
  to acknowledge that he was the unnamed executive in the original
  blog post, and made an apology, saying that "I have made mistakes
  along the way." 
</p>
      <p>
  "I am ashamed that I failed to recognize the imbalance of
  power that exists within a company," Cornelissen wrote, in an
  apology to the former DataCamp employee. "I never intended to
  make you uncomfortable or cause you harm, and I accept
  responsibility for the repercussions of my actions and the impact
  they have had on your personal and professional life."
</p>
      <p>
  In the blog post announcing Cornelissen's leave, the
  DataCamp board of directors says that it's conducting an
  independent third-party investigation into the company's culture
  and working environment, spearheaded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anurima-bhargava-0926927/">civil
  rights attorney Anurima Bhargava.</a> It also says that it's
  assembling an advisory board of DataCamp instructors.
</p>
      <p>
  "[Cornelissen's] return to the company in any capacity will
  be based on the findings of the independent third party
  review...and the recommendations of the Instructor Advisory
  Board...in conjunction with the Board of Directors," says the
  blog post. 
</p>
      <h2>
  <strong>Instructor backlash</strong>
</h2>
      <p>
  Even before DataCamp published its original blog post, the
  company faced backlash from the instructors who teach data
  science education classes on the platform, and who had originally
  pressured the company to comment on the incident.
</p>
      <p>
  Indeed, two days before DataCamp shared its original blog
  post about the incident earlier in April, more than 100
  instructors signed an open letter urging a formal comment from
  the company, and asking for corrective action to prevent it from
  happening again in the future. 
</p>
      <p>
  Now, however, we spoke to four DataCamp instructors who say
  that they're still unsatisfied, even in the wake of the board's
  actions to address the situation. 
</p>
      <p>
  "Any true reckoning will involve not just the CEO's
  actions, but every decision made afterwards to minimize them and
  sweep sexual misconduct under the rug," Noam Ross, a DataCamp
  instructor who had previously criticized the company's response
  to the incident, told Business Insider. "They are
  far from restoring trust. They have lost some of us permanently,
  and the rest are watching closely."
</p>
      <p>
  Os Keyes, a DataCamp instructor - and one of the people who
  first named Cornelissen as the executive in the original blog
  post - is also unsatisfied. Keyes had pulled their courses from
  DataCamp in the wake of the original allegation and instituted a
  boycott of the platform; they do not plan to reverse course now,
  they said. 
</p>
      <p>
  Several of the instructors Business Insider spoke to said
  that they're skeptical that the board of directors will conduct a
  fair review, or that the instructor advisory board - which will
  be appointed by the board -will include any critics willing to
  hold management to account. <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/83549-98">According to
  Pitchbook</a>, the board includes Cornelissen, DataCamp's other
  two cofounders, and a DataCamp investor named Stephen LeSieur.
  
</p>
      <p>
  "If such a board or its review will have any credibility,
  the instructors on it would need to have the trust of the broader
  data science community," DataCamp instructor Julia Silge told
  Business Insider. "Many instructors who fit that description have
  just experienced months of being undermined and gaslit by the
  DataCamp leadership team."

      <p>
  Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google that sits on parent
  company Alphabet's board of directors, has an unusual piece of
  artwork hanging in his office. 
</p>
      <p>
  A custom-made comic strip featuring Apple CEO Tim Cook and
  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seemingly apologizing hangs in the
  doorway of his office, reports <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eric-schmidt-has-lessons-to-pass-along-11556206787">
  The Wall Street Journal.</a> The revelation was made in an
  article discussing the new book Schmidt co-authored alongside two
  other Google executives about renowned Silicon Valley business
  coach Bill Campbell. 
</p>
      <p>
  The artwork depicts Zuckerberg saying, "Sorry, but we're still
  right," and Cook saying, "You're holding it wrong." Schmidt, too,
  is shown in the comic saying, "We screwed up. Sorry."
</p>
      <p>
  The illustration encapsulates Schmidt's approach and the lessons
  he's learned from Campbell, who was known for mentoring
  high-profile executives like Schmidt, Apple co-founder Steve
  Jobs, and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.
  Schmidt's book, which he co-authored alongside Google's Jonathan
  Rosenberg and Alan Eagle, is called "Trillion Dollar Coach: The
  Leadership Playbook of Silicon Valley's Bill Campbell" and was
  released on April 16. 
</p>
      <p>
  It was from Campbell, who died at age 75 in 2016, that Schmidt
  learned how to own up to mistakes, according to The Journal. "If
  you make a mistake, admit it, and do it right now," Schmidt said
  to the newspaper in reference to the lessons he learned from
  Campbell. "And if you didn't make a mistake, don't admit it."
</p>
      <p>
  Schmidt didn't discuss the meaning behind those quotes featured
  in the comic strip when speaking to the Journal. But they sound
  similar to some of the responses Google and Apple have issued to
  controversies in the past.
</p>
      <p>
  For example, when asked in 2010 about using the Google Street
  View program to collect data about personal internet usage,
  Google co-founder Sergey Brin said, "In short, let me just say
  it. We screwed up," according to an article from <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/googles-brin-on-wi-fi-spying-we-screwed-up/">
  CNET</a> published at the time.
</p>
      <p>
  The Tim Cook quote could be a reference to Steve Jobs' response
  to what was known as "Antennagate" back in 2010 following the
  launch of the iPhone 4. Shortly after the device launched,
  customers complained about the phone dropping calls and seeing
  their cell signal bars decrease when their hand bridged the
  exposed antenna located along the bottom of the device. In what
  appeared to be an answer to a customer email regarding the issue,
  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/24/apple-responds-over-iphone-4-reception-issues-youre-holding-th/">
  Jobs issued the now-famous advice</a> to "just avoid holding it
  in that way."
</p>
      <p>
  The theme reflected in Schmidt's comic strip about owning up to
  mistakes may be more relevant than ever today, as companies like
  Google and Facebook face increased scrutiny from regulators, the
  government, and the public. Earlier this month, Facebook was
  under fire after it was discovered that the social network
  harvested email contacts from 1.5 million users without their
  knowledge, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-uploaded-1-5-million-users-email-contacts-without-permission-2019-4">
  Business Insider's Rob Price</a> reported. In late 2018, Google
  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-employees-walkout-protest-andy-rubin-sexual-misconduct-allegations-2018-10">
  grappled with backlash</a> over the way it handled allegations of
  sexual misconduct, leading to worldwide protests in the company's
  offices. Alphabet and Google also face ongoing criticism
  -<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/google-project-dragonfly-employees-quitting">including
  some employees quitting in protest</a> - over Google's secretive
  work on a censored search engine for the China market, which
  internally was called Project Dragonfly.

    <strong>Magic Johnson shockingly resigned from his position as
    president of basketball operations for the Los Angeles Lakers
    in early April.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>According to Bleacher Report's Ric Bucher, Johnson's
    decision may have stemmed from emails between Lakers co-owner
    Jeanie Buss and general manager Rob Pelinka that were critical
    of Magic's performance.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>On Thursday, Johnson cryptically tweeted, "The truth

      <p>
  Magic Johnson's resignation from his position as president
  of basketball operations for the Los Angeles Lakers came in
  sudden and shocking fashion, but according to Bleacher Report
  senior writer Ric Bucher, Magic might have had good reason to
  leave the franchise.
</p>
      <p>
  Bucher was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dii0nin-RIw">a guest on "The Herd" with Colin Cowherd</a> and
  revealed that Johnson may have accidentally been CC'd on emails
  between Lakers co-owner Jeanie Buss and general manager Rob
  Pelinka that were critical of Magic's performance.

  president without telling team owner Jeannie Buss in bizarre and
  shocking move</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  "My understanding is that there were some emails that were
  exchanged between Rob and Jeanie … about Magic and about what
  Magic was and wasn't doing. They were critical emails," Bucher
  said. "And somehow, some way - Jeanie, from what I understand,
  was CCing or blind CCing Magic on everything. ... So, Magic now
  is seeing emails from Rob to Jeanie that were critical of what he
  was doing."
</p>
      <p>
  Bucher went on to say that while Magic seeing these emails would
  have already been bad, what made matters worse was the lack of
  support he received from either party.
</p>
      <p>
  "And maybe most important in all this is that there was no
  indication that Jeanie was backing Rob up in terms of either
  going to Magic and letting him know that this was going on or
  going back at Rob and defending Magic. That was not happening."
</p>
      <p>
  You can watch Bucher's appearance below.

      <p>
  While the story has yet to be confirmed, and Bucher himself
  hedged it as only "his understanding" of the situation, it's
  certainly plausible.
</p>
      <p>
  One of the most shocking aspects of Johnson's decision to leave
  was how sudden it came, and that he had not informed Buss of his
  decision prior to stepping in front of the media to announce it.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lakers-didnt-know-magic-johnson-resigning-2019-4">
  It's becoming clear that nobody on the Lakers knew about or
  expected Magic Johnson's abrupt resignation and few have seen
  anything like it</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  Johnson added fuel to the speculation when he sent out a
  cryptic tweet, implying that the truth has been revealed or would
  be eventually.

  The Los Angeles front office situation hasn't inspired too much
  confidence in Lakers fans since the team moved to bring LeBron
  James to the team.
</p>
      <p>
  If critical emails are being sent haphazardly throughout the
  organization, it would only make an already tenuous picture look
  worse.

  <li>
    <a href="http://shrsl.com/1icw7">Nuria</a> is a skin-care brand focused on clean
    beauty. It's vegan, plant-based, and cruelty-free.
  </li>
  <li>Its products are designed around the natural flora that
  locals around the world have been using for centuries to treat
  the skin concerns common to their regions.
  </li>
  <li>I tried a handful of Nuria products and was overall impressed
  with the gentle, lightweight, and fast-absorbing formulas, as
  well as inventive bottle designs.
  </li>
  <li>Nuria donates a portion of every sale to She's the First, a
  non-profit that fights gender inequality by providing education
  to girls.
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  <a href="http://shrsl.com/1icw7">Nuria</a>, a vegan, plant-based
  skin-care line founded by Johnson &amp; Johnson veteran Naomi
  Furgiuele, is meant to combine all the local skin care wisdom
  hidden in pockets of the world into one encyclopedic master line.
  
</p>
      <p>
  Furgiuele traveled frequently for
  her former job with Johnson &amp; Johnson and observed
  that different communities across
  the globe had different beauty routines specialized to address
  the common skin problems that arose where they lived, as well as
  specific ingredients used to solve them. 
</p>
      <p>
  Nuria products are designed around the natural flora that
  communities have used locally for centuries to treat their common
  skin concerns. For instance, the
  "<a href="http://shrsl.com/1iflw">Rescue</a>" collection is inspired by people who live
  in lush, warm climates that can beget clogged pores. "<a href="http://shrsl.com/1iflt">Defend</a>" is inspired by large cities in Asia and
  the necessity of protecting the skin from internal and external
  aggressors like pollution, and the "<a href="http://shrsl.com/1iflx">Hydrate</a>" collection is inspired by drier, cooler
  European climates.
</p>
      <p>
  Furgiuele, herself a mother of two
  girls, also observed pervasive gender inequality while traveling
  across the globe brainstorming skincare for Johnson &amp;
  Johnson. In an effort to combine profit with purpose, Nuria
  donates a portion of every sale to She's the First, a non-profit
  that fights gender inequality by providing education to girls.
  All proceeds of <a href="http://shrsl.com/1icva">select Gift Sets</a> are donated.
</p>
      <p>
  On Nuria's <a href="http://shrsl.com/1icw7">site</a>, you can shop by collection, product
  category, or skin need. 
</p>
      <p>
  To get a sense of whether the line could be just as good in real
  life as it sounded in theory, I tested a variety of the company's
  best sellers.

      <h2>
  The Nuria skin care I tested
</h2>

      <p>
  <strong><a href="http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;u=1088116&amp;m=85809&amp;urllink=nuriabeauty.com%2Fproduct%2Fdefend-overnight-recovery-cream%2F">Defend Overnight Recovery Cream,
  $48</a></strong>: This defensive overnight cream purports to protect skin against its
  environment. It's made with seaweed and brown algae found along
  coastal Japan to combat free radicals. The seaweed works like a
  super hydrator and also exfoliates dead or dull skin cells and
  toxins. The algae helps prevent damage to amino acids in the
  skin, and the formula's density of fatty acids like omega-6 and
  omega-3 help plump the skin. 
</p>
      <p>
  In person, it's a relatively lightweight, fast-absorbing
  overnight cream. Initially, it may feel sticky, but it will
  absorb completely and quickly if you evenly distribute it. I woke
  up without any clogged pores, residue, or oiliness in my skin.
  Combined with the rest of the products, my skin felt and looked
  clear, hydrated, and fine lines did appear less noticeable.
  However, the biggest benefits of combatting environmental
  aggressors are inherently long term. 
</p>
      <p>
  <strong><a href="http://shrsl.com/1if1j">Hydrate Moisturizing Toner, $24</a></strong>: This
  moisturizing toner is formulated with Mallow Root, a plant with
  antioxidant and calming properties found in eastern Europe. The
  formula also includes rose oil (vitamins, antioxidants),
  chamomile (hydration, reduced effects of photodamage), aloe leaf
  juice (organic clarifying and detoxifying agents), and cucumber
  (decreasing puffiness), <a href="http://shrsl.com/1if1j">among others</a>. It's lightweight,
  hydrating, and non-irritating. 
</p>
      <p>
  <strong><a href="http://shrsl.com/1if1f">Hydrate Moisture Replenishing Serum, $43</a></strong>:
  This serum is hydrating, lightweight, and fast-absorbing in
  person - making it easy to layer with other products. It's made
  with Squalane (a hero ingredient in many moisturizing skin care
  products) made from pressed olives and Everlasting Flower, a
  plant native to Greece that's known to make skin more vibrant. It
  also has Sodium Hyaluronate, which is naturally occurring in the
  body and helps maintain the skin's moisture. 
</p>
      <p>
  The product container is a standout with a twist-off stopper top
  that's refilled by pressing down on a plastic button. I preferred
  the design to other serums, however, the price is probably going
  to be tough to stomach for the average person at $43 for a 25ml
  jar of serum.

  <strong><a href="http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;u=1088116&amp;m=85809&amp;urllink=nuriabeauty.com%2Fproduct%2Frescue-rebalancing-cleanser%2F">Rescue Rebalancing Cleanser,
  $26</a></strong>: This cleanser uses the gentle astringency of
  Japanese mandarin oranges to cleanse the skin and purify clogged
  pores. A combination of minerals and Rice Water - rich in
  vitamins B, C, and E - help tighten skin and shrink pores while
  other ingredients (rosehip oil, loquat extract, and seaweed
  extract) replenish moisture and exfoliate.
</p>
      <p>
  In person, it's a gentle, non-drying cleanser that would probably
  work for most skin types. A standout feature was the clever
  bottle design, which prevents leaks and makes it easier to toss
  into my gym bag and keep my routine consistent. However, the
  bottle is still too large for a carry-on. 
</p>
      <p>
  <strong><a href="http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;u=1088116&amp;m=85809&amp;urllink=nuriabeauty.com%2Fproduct%2Fdefend-triple-action-eye-cream%2F">Defend Triple Action Eye Cream,
  $40</a></strong>: The Triple Action Eye Cream has mulberry root
  (brightens, evens skin tone) and ginseng (reduces fine lines)
  native to China - skin-care ingredients that have been used in
  the region for centuries. The mix of natural ingredients,
  vitamins, antioxidants, and sodium hyaluronate work to restore
  moisture in the delicate under-eye skin and reduce puffiness and
  dark circles.
</p>
      <p>
  This was another instance of a helpful and inventive applicator:
  The top of the small tube is a slanted, disc-shaped smoothing tip
  that you can spread the product with - minimizing or negating how
  much you have to tap or pull at the thin skin. In person, it was
  a rich, fast-absorbing cream that did make my under-eye skin look
  brighter. In terms of price, while eye cream is often expensive,
  I get more bang for my buck from my (currently sold out) <a href="http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;u=1088116&amp;m=80811&amp;urllink=maelove.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-eye-enhancer">$28 go-to</a>.
</p>
      <h2>
  My overall impression
</h2>
      <p>
  I liked each of Nuria's products, but was most impressed by its
  thoughtful product packaging. It made using its serum easier and
  cleansers easier to travel with - even if the bottles were still
  too large for carry-on bags.
</p>
      <p>
  It's difficult to say for certain whether the regional
  ingredients used in the products really did contribute to a
  vastly different skin-care experience. But, regardless, the
  products were great in their own right.
</p>
      <p>
  The products are all vegan, cruelty-free, plant-based, and
  non-irritating, even on my sensitive skin. They're also free of
  parabens, sulfates, phthalates, formaldehyde,
  formaldehyde-releasing agents, hydroquinone, mineral oil, coal
  tar, retinyl palmitate, oxybenzone, triclosan, triclocarban, and
  ethanol. It feels good to know none of that is going on your face
  in your overnight cream and seeping into your pores.
</p>
      <p>
  All in all, Nuria is a solid skin-care brand - and one that will
  send a portion of the money you spent to support girls' education
  across the globe. The products are gentle, non-irritating, do
  what they purport to do, and come in inventive, helpful
  packaging.

    <strong>If you lose your credit card, or if it's stolen, it's
    traditionally been a hassle to resolve.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>However, credit card companies have introduced features
    through websites and mobile apps to give consumers more
    options, and more control, than ever.</strong>
  </li>

    <strong>Card issuers like Barclays, which issues the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/barclaycard-arrival-plus-world-elite-mastercard/?utm_campaign=bi_042419_card-protections&amp;utm_source=referral">

    American Express® Gold Card</a>, have gotten on board with the
    changes.</strong>
  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  Credit cards are an incredibly secure and convenient form of
  payment, but they aren't without their hassles.
</p>
      <p>
  One of my biggest problems is that I regularly forget my card at
  restaurants, especially when the card is a dark color that seem
  to disappear on the folio.
</p>
      <p>
  When this happened in the past, you were often told to cancel
  your misplaced card and have it replaced. This was time
  consuming, and it disrupted all of your recurring payments to
  merchants that had your card on file.
</p>
      <p>
  But now, many card issuers offer features to pause your account,
  temporarily disabling the use of the card while continuing to
  work for recurring payments. For example, Barclays has just begun
  offering this feature, as well as other ways that you can control
  your card.
</p>
      <h2>
  Barclays temporarily locks lost or stolen cards through its
  mobile app
</h2>
      <p>
  Barclays now offers a feature called SecurHold that you can use
  to temporarily lock lost or stolen cards.
</p>
      <p>
  This feature is available to all consumer credit cardholders
  through its mobile app. And while it's meant to secure misplaced
  cards, some people may find it useful when they simply want to
  take a break from spending with their credit card.
</p>
      <p>
  Another feature that Barclays recently introduced is spend
  alerts, which gives you the option to receive real-time alerts
  every time your card is used to make a new purchase. Not only
  does this feature allow you to keep a closer eye on your
  spending, it can also help you to spot a fraudulent charge within
  moments. And by doing so, you can quickly take steps to secure
  your account before the fraud is perpetrated again.
</p>
      <p>
  Barclays is also allowing you to place additional controls on
  additional authorized users.
</p>
      <p>
  For example, you can control the merchant categories that your
  authorized users are approved to make purchases for. Let's say
  that you have given a family member a card with your account, but
  you'd prefer to prevent its use for entertainment purchases, this
  tool now allows you to do so. You can also use it to set spending
  limits per transaction.

      <h2>
  Issuers like AmEx and Capital One have also introduced protective
  measures
</h2>
      <p>
  American Express, which issues cards like the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/the-platinum-card-from-american-express/?utm_campaign=bi_042419_card-protections&amp;utm_source=referral">
  AmEx Platinum</a> and the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/the-american-express-gold-card/?utm_campaign=bi_042419_card-protections&amp;utm_source=referral">
  AmEx Gold</a>, introduced the Freeze Your Card feature last year,
  which can temporarily prevent a card like the from being used for
  new purchases. But it still allows for the payment of recurring
  bills, and for use in your digital wallet, such as Apple Pay or
  Samsung Pay. With this feature, your card will automatically be
  unfrozen in seven days.
</p>
      <p>
  Also, Capital One, which issues cards like the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/capital-one-savor-cash-rewards-credit-card/?utm_campaign=bi_042419_card-protections&amp;utm_source=referral">
  Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card</a> and <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/capital-one-venture-rewards-credit-card/?utm_campaign=bi_042419_card-protections&amp;utm_source=referral">
  Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</a> offers Card Lock that
  blocks all in-store, online, in-app and phone purchases with the
  same number. However, you can continue to return items, make
  payments and redeem rewards while your card is locked. This
  feature is only available in its mobile app.
</p>
      <p>
  Similar features are now available from Chase, Citi, Discover, US
  Bank and Wells Fargo.
</p>
      <p>
  It took a long time, but most major credit card issuers now have
  a way for you to secure your card without having declare it lost
  and have it replaced. And while many major card issuers have
  added a pause button to their cards, Barclays has clearly gone
  beyond that to offer several valuable ways to give you additional
  control over your account. By understanding how these new
  features work, you can make your credit card even more secure and
  convenient than it's ever been.

  <li>
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/amazon">Amazon</a> employs a system that
    not only tracks warehouse workers' productivity but also can
    automatically fire them for failing to meet expectations.
  </li>
  <li>Amazon confirmed that it fired hundreds of people for
  productivity reasons in just one facility over one year's time.
  </li>
  <li>It said that the rate at which it is firing people from its
  warehouses has decreased.
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>
      <p>
  Amazon's demanding culture of worker productivity has been
  revealed in multiple investigations. But a new report indicates
  that the company doesn't just track worker productivity at its
  warehouses - it also has a system that can automatically fire
  them.
</p>
      <p>
  Amazon has fired more than 300 workers, citing productivity, at a
  single facility in Baltimore in a single year (August 2017
  through September 2018), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations">
  The Verge's Colin Lecher reported</a>. The Verge cited a
  letter by an Amazon attorney as part of a case with the National
  Labor Relations Board. 
</p>
      <p>
  An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider,
  "Approximately 300 employees turned over in Baltimore
  related to productivity in this timeframe. In general, the number
  of employee terminations have decreased over the last two years
  at this facility as well as across North America."
</p>
      <p>
  Amazon's system tracks a metric called "time off task," meaning
  how much time workers pause or take breaks, The Verge reported.
  It has been previously reported that some workers feel so
  pressured that they don't take bathroom breaks.
</p>
      <p>
  <em><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-warehouse-workers-have-to-pee-into-bottles-2018-4">Undercover author finds Amazon
  warehouse workers in UK 'peed in bottles' over fears of being
  punished for taking a break</a></em>
</p>
      <p>
  If the system determines the employee is failing to meet
  production targets, it can automatically issue warnings and
  terminate them without a supervisor's intervention, although
  Amazon said that a human supervisor can override the system. The
  company also said it provides training to those who don't meet
  their production goals.
</p>
      <p>
  While all employees in every job know they could be fired if they
  fail to meet their performance objectives, few of us are managed
  by an automated system tracking our every movement that has full
  authority to make that decision.
</p>
      <p>
  And, of course, people are not robots. People have highly
  productive days and less-productive days. The true benefit of a
  human workforce isn't to use people like cogs in a production
  wheel, but to employ humans who are creative, can solve problems,
  and can learn and grow if they are given the breathing room to
  contribute.
</p>
      <p>
  Nevertheless, Amazon's mechanisms for exacting productivity are
  pervasive in many areas of its operations. For instance, drivers
  delivering Amazon packages have reported feeling so pressured
  that they speed through neighborhoods, blow by stop signs, and
  pee in bottles in the trucks or outside, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-delivery-drivers-say-they-speed-urinate-in-bottles-2018-9">
  Business Insider's Hayley Peterson reported</a>.
</p>
      <p>
  And as Amazon's business continues to grow, the company's need to
  deliver ever more packages as fast as possible isn't going away
  any time soon.
