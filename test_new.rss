				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vijay was born on 22 June 1974 as Joseph Vijay in Madras (now Chennai). He is a Roman Catholic. He received his first Holy Communion at a church in Chennai. His father S. A. Chandrasekhar is a Tamil film director and his mother Shoba is a playback singer and carnatic vocalist. He had a sister Vidhya, who died when she was two years old. Vidhya&#8217;s death affected Vijay very much. It has been said by his mother that Vijay, who was very talkative, naughty and hyperactive as a child, became silent after Vidhya&#8217;s death. His sibling Vidhya&#8217;s story is depicted in the 2005 film Sukran, where Vijay played an extended cameo.[better source needed]</p>
<p>Vijay spent his entire childhood in Chennai. He did his schooling initially in Fathima Matriculation Higher Secondary School at Kodambakkam and later joined Balalok Matriculation Higher Secondary School at Virugambakkam and went on to pursue a degree in Visual Communications from Loyola College, though he eventually dropped out as he was more interested in pursuing acting.</p>
